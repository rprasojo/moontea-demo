	Honestly according to the Westphalian nation-state concept, many non-Western societies were not 'states' until quite recently. But they were countries, with governments, and with an idea of being a country.

Now I'm not pro-free Tibet. but Tibet definitely had its own form of governance and was a diverse place historically.
