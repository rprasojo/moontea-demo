	Great Article however, the author never discussed "soft power" and the cultural relationship that Japan and the United States share with each other. Americans (those who know the difference between China and Japan) overwhelmingly despise China and have multiple cultural ties to Japanese culture. The true and final question is: Are Americans willing to die for Tokyo? Beijing thinks not but, I’m willing to wager that Beijing is wrong. The next few Aircraft carriers we decommission should be gifted to Japan. The President should visit the Yaukuni Shrine along with the UK and Australian Prime Ministers. There is no reason why China, a morally bankrupt oppressive dictatorship should be anything besides a pariah in the eyes of the international community. The Dalai Lama still cannot return home, Tibet is not free, Hong Kong is oppressed, and the South China sea is not for sale.
