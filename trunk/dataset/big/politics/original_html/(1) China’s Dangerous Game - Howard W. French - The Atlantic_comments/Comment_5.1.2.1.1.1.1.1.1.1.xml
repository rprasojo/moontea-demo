	Gaah! I replied to you and then I thought I should add a "who are", which I contracted to oops can't type it because Disqus thought I was using a bad word and now my comment is waiting to be approved and we all know that means it's gone forever.

Copy/paste from that post:

The fact that we're seeing different users as Guest makes this a much stranger and more troubling problem. If you're correct that it's the troll armies WHO ARE behind this, and not the Thetans that were my first guess, then that would really suck. As bad as The Atlantic comments can be, this site is miles above most of the other news and commentary sites on the interweb.
