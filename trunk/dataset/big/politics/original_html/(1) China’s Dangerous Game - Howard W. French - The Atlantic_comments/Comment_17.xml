	don't know why Indonesia is not discussed more in these conversations about east Asian geopolitics. they have a huge population, a large land mass, and they control a lot of the navigable waterways from the Indian Ocean into these disputed areas. also happens to be a Muslim country.

China has a lot to deal with. the environment could collapse before any of this territorial stuff matters.
