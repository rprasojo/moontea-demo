	Freedom and liberty? That's great!! Sincerely, you made my day, thank you very much ^^ Adapt censorship, arrest people who are making questions, kill cultural and religious minorities and force an integration of Han culture everywhere in the country is freedom? No doubt you consider the caustic relation between east and west as a mere form of racism...
