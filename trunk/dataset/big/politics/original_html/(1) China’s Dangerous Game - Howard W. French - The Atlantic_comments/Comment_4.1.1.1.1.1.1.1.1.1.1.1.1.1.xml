	Negotiation: noun

1. mutual discussion and arrangement of the terms of a transaction or agreement: "the negotiation of a treaty."

You know, like exactly what happened in the First Armistice at Compiègne. If you would care to offer some wholly unique, not commonly accepted definition of negotiation that magically includes the resolution to the Korean War and not WW1, by all means offer it up. Until then, I'm afraid it appears you are the one that has no idea what they are talking about.
