	Really? Please find me ONE (1) parallel, undertaken by either Russia or China since World War 2, in which either of those countries engaged in something like the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq.

Oh, and of course, to satisfy this request, you'll have to find a situation in which (for example) either Russia or China sailed a battle fleet, literally around the world, and -- in the face of nearly unanimous international condemnation -- launched a full-scale military invasion and years-long occupation of a country oceans away from them. (I know you're going to bring up Tibet and Afghanistan, and while I deplored both of these situations, I'd note that both of them were right on the borders of the superpowers involved, and that at least in Russia's case this was undertaken by a regime that is no longer there -- in sharp contrast to the United States, in which the same oligopoly has been in charge literally since the Industrial Revolution.)

While you're at it... can you find me where Russia or China have engaged in a world-wide program of kidnap and torture, such as "extraordinary rendition"? Make sure to show me all the helpless Third World peasants who Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping have murdered with remote-controlled drone strikes.

Or maybe you're just a "proxy" for American state propaganda, yourself. How... pathetic.
