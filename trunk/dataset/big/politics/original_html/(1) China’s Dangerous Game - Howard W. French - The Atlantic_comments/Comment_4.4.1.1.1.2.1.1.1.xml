	In my experience in traveling through Tibetan areas, they do want the same things Han Chinese want, adequate wages, housing, environment, and education for their children. That's top concern. Some very religious people such as monks are concerned about establishing an independent religious state or for the return of the Dalai Lama but most are far more concerned with the everyday issues.
