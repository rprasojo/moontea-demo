	Anti US?... Or purely logical?... All empires end.... read history. The "US" is fast fading from the fearful power that it was.... only 50 years ago.

New powers rise and prosper and peak out.. and the cycle is repeated.

The people that have issues with this rock n roll of history are the ones who have the narrow view of their own neighborhood, state, country etc. etc. Or.... the "New World Order freaks of nature who really think that somehow they can cram all the peoples of the world into a box and control it.
