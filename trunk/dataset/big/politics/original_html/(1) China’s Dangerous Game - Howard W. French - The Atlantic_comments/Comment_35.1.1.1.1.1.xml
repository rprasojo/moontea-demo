	At least we remember our own history. The Chinese are enthusiastically erasing theirs, and now making up a maritime empire that never existed, and a Tibet as part of China that has scarcely any more validity.

If you ask the Vietnamese, or the Koreans, or the Tibetans, or many others of their neighbors, they'll tell you the Chinese (and the Japanese, more recently) are their perpetual invaders. Americans know what we did in Vietnam, and in Korea and the Philippines for that matter. Curious how, after all that, the Vietnamese and Koreans and Filipinos still primarily fear the Chinese and are at least intermittently fond of us.
