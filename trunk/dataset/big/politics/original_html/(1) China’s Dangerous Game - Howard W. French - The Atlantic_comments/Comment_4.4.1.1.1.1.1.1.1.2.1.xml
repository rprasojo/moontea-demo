	Should South Central LA or Harlem secede from the United States because of racism? Is the US holding on to Puerto Rico because it has the valuable Arecibo observatory?

Come on of course any minority faces bigotry, which is part of the reason China's affirmative action program reaches further than that of the US. Of course the struggle against racism isn't over but it's a continual process. BTW. Tibetan people live all over China not just in Tibet or historic areas where they used to live.

Many people of Tibetan race, for example, migrate to Shanghai and other major cities without an issue. They join the Communist party and have regular jobs, live in suburbs like everyone else.
