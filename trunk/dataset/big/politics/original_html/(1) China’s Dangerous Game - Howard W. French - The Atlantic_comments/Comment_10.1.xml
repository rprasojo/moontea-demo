	It is not the weapons that demonstrate seriousness, but the willingness to use them... Not the same, at all. Some European countries have nuclear weapons, but no testicles to use them, ever. It is not the gun in the hand that will defend against an aggressor/attacker, but the will to pull the trigger...
