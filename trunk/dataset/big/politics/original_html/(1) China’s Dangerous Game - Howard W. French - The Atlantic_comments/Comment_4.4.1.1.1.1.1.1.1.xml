	I think that if every generation had a vote on what country they'd be part of, Hong Kong might leave China but I believe that in Tibet, it will be either a very close match or they will not leave.

Of course I could be wrong. Remember that migrants are not representative of whole populations. There are some Mandarin speaking Tibetans that I've met who are not pro independence. But from what I remember I think the Dalai Lama doesn't support complete independence either.
