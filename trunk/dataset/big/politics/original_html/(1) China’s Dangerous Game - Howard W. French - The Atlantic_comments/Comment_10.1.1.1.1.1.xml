	You might have missed the two last military engagements we had been involved in, Iraq and Afghanistan, but I seriously doubt that there is anyone, including the Iraqis and the Afghans, who would doubt that we, the US, had by far the best and most weapons in either military theater, and I don't really think it is in doubt that, we did not accomplish the military aims we had when we got involved in either country. We were not willing to do what was needed to accomplish our missions we set out to accomplish at the beginning of the hostilities. I really don't think that the point I made has not been sufficiently demonstrated by the adduced examples. So, again, it is not the weapons at all, but the will to fight is what matters. We, the US, have both the qualitative and the quantitative edge over the Chinese when it comes to any military metric, save the number of troops, but that is immaterial in the naval theater we are discussing here; and we will maintain that qualitative and quantitative edge for many years to come - the will to fight I am not sure about at all...
