	"But when China sails as far as a mere few hundred miles south near Vietnam, oh no, the world sh-ts its pants"

Uh no, not "the world." Rather, the leaders of Vietnam and the Philippines s**t in their pants. The current situation in the South China Sea would indeed be a non-issue IF all Southeast Asians were more than willing to roll over and submit to Chinese domination. The fact that they will not is something of an inconvenient problem for Beijing.
