	You care to present evidence of why he's wrong?

The CCP is balanced on a knife's edge and one of the supports they rely on to stay up is pandering to nationalism. If they lose a small war on their periphery, it'd be catastrophic for their efforts to maintain control. Even worse would be backing down from one in the face of American or Japanese power, which may well see them thrown out of power within a year.
