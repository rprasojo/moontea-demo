	You're so sure of that opinion (that I'm paid to express my views) like the rest of your opinions. So sure and so lacking in evidence that it is you that seems to be a paid stooge or at least deeply brainwashed.

BTW, I'm an American citizen who has never been paid to express any opinion. You, I'm not so sure. There is such a thing as a sock puppet, someone that is paid by the US government to spread propaganda.
