	That is a rather bold take on history. To suggest that those who could not muster either the courage or the will to defeat "small less developed countries" will all the sudden find the courage and will to defeat large developed countries is far, very far from being credible; or anywhere near realistic. You are merely being mulish and resorting to caviling and what not; and you have not presented anything at all to support your take on the matter. Go ahead and keep on believing whatever you like, that is your prerogative...
