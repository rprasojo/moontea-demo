	Where in the world did you get the idea that the UK wanted to go to war against the US at any point during the 20th century? The treaty you're speaking of was designed to contain German and Japanese naval construction, so there wouldn't be a repeat of the bankrupting Dreadnought race that led up to the Great War.
