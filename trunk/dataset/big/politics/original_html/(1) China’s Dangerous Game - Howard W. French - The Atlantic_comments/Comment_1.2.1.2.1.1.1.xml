	While i agree that democracy does not cures all, it prevents from getting worse. Since you are using India-China comparison, in the 60s when both India and China had more or less similar per capita incomes, India did not experience mass tragedies like 'Great leap forward' and the resultant famines and deaths which China experienced.
