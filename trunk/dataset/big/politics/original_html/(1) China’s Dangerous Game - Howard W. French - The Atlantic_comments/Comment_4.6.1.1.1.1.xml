	What are you talking about? You confused km with nautical miles. I pointed that out.

You seem to have me confused with someone else.

BTW, both the Taiwanese government and the PRC claim that Taiwan is part of China.

Of course, they don't agree about what exactly that means, or who is the legitimate political authority, or did you also conveniently forget the last 60 odd years of history?
