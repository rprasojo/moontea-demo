	Thanks for the stupid "straw man" attack.

Nobody here suggested that China is a democracy. What I and others have been saying is, American nationalists and jingoists are whining about China engaging in a very mild version of the gunboat diplomacy that has been engaged in by the United States, for over a century now. It was just fine and dandy when it was done by English-speaking white people, but oh, my goodness! We can't let those yellow Chinese play "our" little imperialist game.

Well, sorry, squire... nonsense propaganda of this type may play very well in Topeka, but it doesn't play very well at all in, say, Shanghai... not to mention Jakarta.
