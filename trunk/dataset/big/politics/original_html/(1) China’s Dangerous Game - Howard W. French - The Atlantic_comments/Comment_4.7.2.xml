	This list is absurd if anybody knows anything. But just one example, China invaded India in 1962?

Sure the Indian has been saying this for a long time, and they still insist that they are just hapless innocent victim against big bad China. In fact at the time of the incident, the West overwhelmingly take the Indian line. After all isn't India a democracy and China a Communist nation and that's the end of the story?

Nowadays a body of works has emerged and challenge this narrative and they give a quite convincing evidence that it is India who is the belligerent. Here are two links for anyone who is interested.
