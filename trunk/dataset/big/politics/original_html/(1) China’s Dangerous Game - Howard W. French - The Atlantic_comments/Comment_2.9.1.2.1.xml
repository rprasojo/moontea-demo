	Would that be the Law of the Sea Convention, that the United States -- uniquely among all the world's developed nations (because of fanatical, conspiracy-theory reactionary dogma on the part of the Republican Party) -- obstinately refuses to sign, implement or respect?

So please, don't speak for "the law of the sea". Almost everyone, China included, can be or does respect or implement it. ONLY AMERICA sits there thumbing its nose at this (along with scores of other) articles of international law. China will have to go a long way before it gets anywhere near America's fundamental contempt towards the rest of the world.
