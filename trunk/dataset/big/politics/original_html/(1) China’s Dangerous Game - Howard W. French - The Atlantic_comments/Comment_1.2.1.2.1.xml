	I did get a laugh at the dig at India's (96/177 in the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index) level of corruption, when corruption is just as endemic in both China (80/177) and especially Russia (127/177).

(By comparison, the United States' ranking is 19/177.)

And much of the economic growth in China has been fueled by the "shadow banking" system, which is functionally the equivalent of a house of cards built on quicksand. There are other signifiicant challenges to the vision of economic integration outlined above, but I can't be bothered to write a W.O.T. at the moment.
