	Yawn...

Oh I wish prose and thought when together but your writing belies too much anti-US bias to be taken as anything more than ranting. But from your screed it is clear that you really don't care about 'people' or 'rights' (China and Russia!) The Pax-China is about to end and Putin's bare chest and regressive policies are a bit hard to idolize.

But thanks for the rant - it made me laugh.
