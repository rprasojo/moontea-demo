	Both Southeastern Asian claimants and the US are using each other for their perspective gains; for the U.S. geopolitical leverage against China and for the smaller flies in the southeast Asian claimants and Japan (in East China Sea dispute with China) a perceived deterrent or protection in the case of Japan and the Philippines. The danger is that some small flies (like the Serb guy in Sarajevo) could cause mighty nations to go to self-destructive war like that in Europe in 1914 (which cost Britain superpower status and losing its grip on its colonies worldwide); that same thing could happen to the US as well albeit "exceptional" or "near chosen," if the US is not careful.
