	Oh, that's interesting. I have never met (on the Internet or anywhere else) a Westerner who went to China to study advanced engineering (any kind). We started getting Chinese (PRC) grad students in my department (physics) in the early '80s, but never heard of anyone (Westerner) getting a PhD in physics in China. The same was true in the Engineering departments, too. Meaning, they were coming to the US, and not the other way around. Of course, by now it is a different setup, because the Chinese have done some really large scale civil engineering projects (trains, bridges, dams, etc.) in the last few decades, so they seem to know what they are doing. I am curious, though. Is the instruction in Chinese or in English? It may sound funny, but all the physicists and chemists from the PRC I had contact with indicated that, higher level science books, and the concomitant lecturing using those books, were in English. This had more to do with linguistics than anything else. I am genuinely curious. Or, you have mastered Mandarin to the level, where you not only follow lectures in Mandarin, but read graduate level texts in it. Rather nice. Your field must be quite specialized because I haven't heard of many post docs getting positions from Chinese universities. They want to come here for grad school. Well, at least the ones I came across. I do not meant to belittle the Chines higher education at all, but am just curious and I have had some personal experience with Chinese (PRC and ROC, too) grad students. That's all. Anyway, One learns something new every day...
