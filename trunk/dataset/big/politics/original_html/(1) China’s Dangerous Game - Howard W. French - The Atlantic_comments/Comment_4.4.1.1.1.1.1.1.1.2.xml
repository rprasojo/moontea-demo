	You are absolutely incorrect; unlike Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia, which have been flooded with Han colonists over the last two centuries until they are, respectively, 45% and 85% Han, Tibet remains well over 80% ethnically Tibetan. Even leaving aside religious issues, those Tibetans constitute an abused majority with little more political and economic power than Africans had under Apartheid. Direct racism isn't as prevalent, but the sheer prevalence of the security state and the automatic suspicion it exercises towards non-Han people in Tibet put the worst excesses of Stop-and-Frisk to shame.

Put it to a vote and I guarantee they'd leave in a heartbeat, but Beijing understandably cannot consider the possibility as the Tibetan Plateau contains the headwaters for the river systems which supply three-quarters of a billion people with water and food. What it would do, if it was even vaguely reasonable on the issue, is try to treat the locals well enough that they wouldn't feel the need to leave, just as it should be doing in Xinjiang, which it similarly *must* control in order to secure overland access to energy resources from Central Asia and Russia.
