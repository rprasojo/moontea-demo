	We (U.S.) should make a temporary strategic withdrawal from the Western Pacific. If China's threat is real, this will create fear and worry among other countries in the region. Without the guaranteed U.S. protective umbrella, they will feel more threatened by China, and will strengthen their militaries and form alliances among themselves. These alliances, likely led by Japan and India, will be able to present a strong counterweight to China's potential aggression. With such strong allies, and providing them additional material and reserve forces, we will be able to easily overcome any threat in the area.

Same strategy applies to our Russian worries.

I know, withdrawing seems counter-intuitive and weak. However, often times it is the best move. By making a temporary strategic withdrawal, we will secure our position in the long run.

Think of the way a good player plays chess. He/she will just as willingly move a piece back, if it strategically beneficial. Being emotionally attached to any particular position, whether forward or rear, is a huge mistake.
