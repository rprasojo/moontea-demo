	What you have there, squire, is a long list of bafflegab excuses, self-referential pseudo-legal pleadings, jingoistic periodical articles by creatures of the U.S. military-industrial complex (John Odom, for example, is a former U.S. Army officer... what do you think people would say, if I started to quote opinion pieces by former officers of the People's Liberation Army?) and red herrings (similar to the tactics endlessly used by pro-settler propagandists, in trying to "prove" that the West Bank "always 'belonged' to Jews, even though it was 'temporarily' occupied by Palestinians for hundreds of years") to distract viewers from the basic fact that the United States -- virtually alone among major nations -- has obstinately refused to sign, ratify or implement the Law of the Sea treaty.

You want to talk about anything and everything EXCEPT this undeniable fact, which, unfortunately for you, invalidates your entire argument -- because you can't sit there bawling about "those nasty Chinese and how they're 'misinterpreting' a treaty that they SIGNED" -- when your own beloved country didn't even SIGN the damn thing in the first place, and makes a point of its having refused to do so. This is equivalent to, "you get in a car accident with an uninsured driver, and then he shrieks at you for not picking a low enough deductible for your insurance policy".

What Americans like you think they are accomplishing with this kind of ridiculously (and transparently) self-serving, rankly hypocritical propaganda, honestly escapes me. Whatever one can say about the Chinese (and for the record I am not a fan of their corrupt dictatorship), they at least have the modesty not to harangue other nations for not complying with treaties that they, themselves, thumbed their noses at.
