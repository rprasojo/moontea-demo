	First of all Tibet was part of the former Mongolian and Manchurian empires, which also colonized central China. The issue is that I think they consented to be part of Mongolia and Manchuria, and those cultures were historically very different from mainstream Chinese culture, but more similar to Tibet.

When the socialist revolution happened it spread to many Asian countries. If Tibet had become independent, it may have become Soviet like Mongolia. Actually, one issue with Tibet was that the US's CIA went there in the 1950s to get them to break from socialism.

A lot of the public opinion you hear about free Tibet etc. comes from people living in Nepal and India. I don't know if they're representative of Tibetans in general.
