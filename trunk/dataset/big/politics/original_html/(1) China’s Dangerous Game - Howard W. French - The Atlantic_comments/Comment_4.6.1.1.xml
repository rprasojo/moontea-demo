	I like the subtle shift in your own statement from nautical miles when referencing *Chinese* territorial claims to kilometers when referencing other territorial claims.

I also wonder how you reconcile this argument about "main Japanese island" of Naha (thus conveniently excluding Sakishima-Sohto, despite there being towns and cities with continual populations) with the construction of Islands being used to expand territorial claims far south of Mainland China which are clearly within 200 nautical miles of the coasts of Vietnam and the Philippines. For those wondering, the closest island of the Sakishima-Soto group is 200 kilometers from the Senkaku islands, or 108 nautical miles.
