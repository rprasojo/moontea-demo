	I doubt it. Take the US out of the picture and you get a nuclear Japan (and probably Australia and possibly Indonesia) and much more developed multi-lateral defense cooperation. Right now these nations all use bilateral relationships between themselves and the US and rely on the US to coordinate because they have historical hatreds that make direct cooperation politically unpalatable.

However, the threat of hanging (if the US were to give up and withdraw from the region) would concentrate their minds wonderfully, I suspect, to the point where little niceties like "historical dislike" would go out the window in the scramble to assemble enough Lilliputians to tie down the large man lurking in the corner.
