	It's an interesting experience, but I'm actually a civil engineering student, not a humanities one. Generally speaking the quality of the education is good (I'm at one of the better engineering schools here), and the students are driven, but the culture is really different, obviously.

As for Maslow, I'm an engineering student but I went to an undergraduate university that has pretty intensive humanities requirements, so...

And yes, watching how China and the West portray themselves and each other is entertaining. Even more entertaining (and terrifying) still, though, is watching how Japan and China portray themselves and each other. The gap in perceptions is incredible.
