	They depend on American customers at least as much. As we depend on their production, but perhaps slightly less. The real interdependence is trade, not who owns the bonds, which could be unloaded smoothly and quickly (at a slight discount) to Europeans and Japanese and Arabs, even back to American buyers, in fairly short order. It would be much harder to find new customers on the scale of American imports from China.
