	I just keep laughing and laughing when people bring up international law and how the world isn't like it used to be in the times of WWI and WWII. US invading everybody (reminiscent of Nazi Germany), China expanding, Russia expanding, Europe in crisis, large swaths of Africa in crisis, Mexico falling apart at the seams, people fleeing South America, wars for oil and resources everywhere, Ebola stalking the world and just getting started. All we need is for Arch Duke Ferdinand to get shot and blammo!
