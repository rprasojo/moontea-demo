	a better summation i couldn't have come up with. Bravo!

But, no really: you hit the nail on the head when you stated that in the PRC, all foreign policy is in actuality domestic policy. It dovetails nicely with the fact that the PRC spends more on its internal security apparatus than it does its military. This is further backed up by the fact that the PRC is constantly generating foreign enemies in order to defuse domestic discontent. Protests in Hong Kong? They must be bought and paid for by the west. Philippines, Vietnam et al arresting poachers and illegal fishermen within their mandated EEZs? They must be part of a broader coalition to choke off the PRC's rise.

Small wonder then, with this kind of jingoistic narrative repeated over and over again, that despite having the second highest military spending in the world and safely being able to contest all of their neighbors, they still regard themselves as a victim; they've scared themselves into it, and they're quite good at being completely bipolar, too.
