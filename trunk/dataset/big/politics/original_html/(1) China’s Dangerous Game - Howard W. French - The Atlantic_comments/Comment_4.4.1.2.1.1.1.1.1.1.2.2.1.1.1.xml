	Agreed. There's just so much misinformation that makes it sound like there was this "happy Shangri-la kingdom of Tibet" that was peacefully minding it's own business in Buddhist harmony when the big, bad Chinese communists invaded. Um, no. There was a patchwork of ethnic Tibetan kingdoms and communities that had been part of the Qing empire along with many other central and Southeast Asian tribes. After the fall of the Qing, they meandered their own way, sometimes under various foreign (Indian, Soviet, Chinese) influences, but remained part of the new Chinese Republic for all nominal purposes, and never really rejected it's position as Chinese territory- until it became clear that China wanted to run it as a Chinese territory, and not as a Tibetan-administered tributary sending tax revenues to Beijing in exchange for military protection. Which reminds me of another territory that's in the news a lot right now, but that's another story...
