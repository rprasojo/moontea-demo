	Of course, there's one crucial difference between the Soviet Union's millitary buildup and China's- Deng pegged the military buildup to GDP, insisting that the military's share could never rise about 4% on his watch (unlike the Soviet Union, whose military took roughly 25-35% at it's peak).

It never has, but back when 4% meant 4% of squat, it wasn't much of a threat. Now that it's 4% of the world's second largest economy... that's a whole different ballgame.

Smart. Very, very smart.
