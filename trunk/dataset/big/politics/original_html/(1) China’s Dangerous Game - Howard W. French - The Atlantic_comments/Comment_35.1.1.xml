	Because their so called leaders are as corrupt as H***. they have been bought out by the almighty US dollar decades ago. The leaders' interests are not intent on the benefits of their populations but on their own bank accounts. America has used this fact to totally subvert most of these nations. I would have thought you knew this already.
