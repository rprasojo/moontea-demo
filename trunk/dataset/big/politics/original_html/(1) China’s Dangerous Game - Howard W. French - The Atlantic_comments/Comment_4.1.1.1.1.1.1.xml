	I never said the conflicts were peaceful. Do you need remedial reading lessons? I said that they were resolved through peaceful negotiations (true). That doesn't mean nor imply that there weren't at some point some conflicts with some countries. BTW, the Korean war was not a territorial conflict between China and another country.
