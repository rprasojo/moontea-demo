	This article is comprehensive, but lacks one major component—Russia. Russia has skin in the game of Asia. It has its disputed regions with Japan, it has a stake in controlling the DPRK and the nuclear threat from North Korea. It has a new very strategic economic relationship with China.

How do you write a major review of the last several years of the state of the East China and South China Sea disputes and leave Russia out?
