	"he locals are good enough to dig ditches but the Chinese require imported labor for precise, delicate work like basic construction."

Depends. Dambisa Moyo found out otherwise- in countries with underdeveloped labor forces, like Angola or Mozambique, this was generally true- Chinese employees either equalled or outnumbered African employees on projects. OTOH, in countries with more developed labor forces, like Senegal, Ghana or Botswana, Chinese were generally outnumbered by Africans 20:1 or 30:1. If the locals have the talents they need, which in the more educated nations they do, they hire them. If they don't, they import them.

"They do send a lot of money for housing development and you can see that it's working - the officials who collect it develop much larger houses."

Sub-Saharan African nations with a lot of Chinese investment are suddenly posting GDP growth rates in the 8-10% range. Why is that?

Chinese projects are denominated in RMB. You know what the great thing about RMB is? It's non-transferrable, and only useful for importing goods from China or construction contracts. Unlike Euros or Dollars, which can be smuggled offshore by elites, used to buy expensive luxury products or offshore real estate. So suddenly the influx of RMB is plugging the leaky sieve of "free trade", and igniting the local economies.

Check out Dambisa Moyo or Deborah Brautigam's works for the full story of why China's popularity has risen in Africa.
