	Much of the blood you are talking was spilled by native Crimean Tartars... Countless thousands were murdered by the Red Terror in 1920. Countless thousands more died of starvation in the famine of 1921/22, when the Soviets confiscated all their grain. Tens of thousands more were murdered in the terror of 1929 in the Crimea. Then even more during the purges of 1937/38. Then the entire population of Tartars was deported to Siberia in 1944 for collaborating with the Germans (yes..the Tartars found them easier to get along with than the Soviets), killing countless thousands more. They eventually returned to the Crimea but in numbers far less than a few generations earlier.

You are wrong about Khrushchev being a Ukrainian. Most school children know he was born in Kalinovka, Russia, which is near Kursk. He was 100% Russian. He was the Soviet Commissar to the Ukraine however. Stalin wanted another Russian keeping them under his heal. I am assuming you are just making up facts to support him making the Crimea part of the Ukraine. He did so primarily because all land links to the peninsula from the mainland went through the Ukraine.

Besides that, you are right. After Russia defeated the Turks, and started eliminating the native tartars, they did achieve a majority of Russians there.

Nobody except you and other Russians feel that justifies them to invade and confiscate part of a sovereign nation however.
