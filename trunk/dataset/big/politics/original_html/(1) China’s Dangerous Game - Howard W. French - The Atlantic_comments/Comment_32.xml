	I noticed the standard map of China you see on the walls of restaurants and hotels everywhere had to be shrunk down dramatically in scale in order to fit the "nine-dash-line". No special inset like Alaska\Hawaii in American maps. They were only able to show half the content that would fit on the sheet otherwise.
