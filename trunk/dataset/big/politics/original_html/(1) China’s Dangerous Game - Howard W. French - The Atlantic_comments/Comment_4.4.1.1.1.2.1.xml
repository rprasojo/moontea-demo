	"The issue is that I think they consented to be part of Mongolia and Manchuria, and those cultures were historically very different from mainstream Chinese culture, but more similar to Tibet."

They did not have a vote so you don't know if they consented. I think the population and the leaders were completely against being subjugated by the Mongols. But in the case of China, at least the Dalai Lama consented during the 18th century that China had suzerainty over Tibet. See Melvyn Goldstein's book, The Snow Lion and the Dragon for example.
