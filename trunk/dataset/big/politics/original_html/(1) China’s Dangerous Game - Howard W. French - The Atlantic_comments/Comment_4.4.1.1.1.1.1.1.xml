	Yes, your argument is in fact a red herring. And a fat juicy one at that. Even the southern states opted to fully rejoin the union (although I will concede it was a little like the situation in Tibet) after the civil war. What you are implying is that what, every generation should have a vote on what country they want to be part of? If that were to take place, the US would still very likely have 50 states. China would be TIbetless.
