	Outer Mongolia is culturally and politically influenced by their ties to the old USSR, but today is basically an economic satrap of the PRC. Russia doesn't need their resources- China does. Tibet, similarly, has all it's logistical and business ties to the Chinese metropolitan core, and would still be under their economic domination were it "independent".
