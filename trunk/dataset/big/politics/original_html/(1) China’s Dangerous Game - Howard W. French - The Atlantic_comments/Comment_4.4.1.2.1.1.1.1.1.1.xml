	I'm much less interested in the substance of your talking points than observing that you are quite clearly a paid spokesperson for the People's Republic of China. If I wanted to debate the official Chinese talking points, I could just call the embassy and talk with someone who is at least upfront about who is paying them to say what they're saying.

I mean, c'mon...there's no conflict between Tibet and China? That's just a bridge too far, my Sino friend.
