	Dismissing other people's opinion just because it does not gel with your preconceived notion is unproductive. There is actually a peer-reviewed comprehensive study on China's border management done by a political scientist in MIT and it paints a very different picture than the popular belief of an expansionist China.

The study is some what dated (published in 2008) but the main points in the study remain valid.
