	It was a kingdom; not a state in the modern, westphalian-system sense. Their lack of a sense of statehood went to the point that when offered recognition by the United Nations in the late 1940s, they rejected it, insisting that they were part of China. This was the way the situation stood until it became clear to the Dalai Lama's clique in the late 50s that they wouldn't have the autonomy that they expected and had enjoyed under previous regimes and dynasties... at which point they began to retroactively claim statehood. A decade and a half too late. (Note that the ROC government on Taiwan has never rescinded their claim to Tibet or Xinjiang either- or Outer Mongolia for that matter, which is a recognized, independent state.)

It becomes increasingly evident when you look at what the Tibetan Government in Exile claims as Tibet, which includes a lot more than the Xizang rump-province; it includes all of Qinghai, which is less than a third Tibetan to begin with, and has historically had large populations of Hui, Han, and other minorities. The Dalai Lama himself was born in Gansu province, which has been recognized as part of the Chinese core going back for centuries, but contains many Tibetan villages.

The whole idea of a Tibetan "state" simply doesn't make sense when superimposed on the ethnic complexities of central Asia. Same as the various manufactured "states" of the Middle East.
