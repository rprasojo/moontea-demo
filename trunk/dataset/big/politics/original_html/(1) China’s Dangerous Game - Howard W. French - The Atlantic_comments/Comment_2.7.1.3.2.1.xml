	Ironically, the USSR and China (both the Republic of, and the People's Republic of) have been, combined or individually, responsible for far more deaths than the U.S has in all of its wars; during the purges, upwards of 20 million disappeared in Russia, and a further 30 million died as a result of World War II. The "Great Leap Forward" in China, as well as the "Cultural Revolution" were, directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of another 30 million, largely due to famine caused by poor economic policy.

That these crimes were committed against the people of one's own nation rather than the peoples of other nations makes them no less significant.

Further, as far as aggression goes, you may also want to check out the wars that Russia and China have been involved in. Finland, Georgia, Ukraine, Poland (Russia), and Tibet, Vietnam, Korea and India (China) figure prominently.

Thus, while the U.S is certainly the most prolific offender, it is hardly the only one. Your myopia regarding the U.S reveals a single-minded, almost conspiratorial bias, which I have seen many a time before.

Put more simply: you are a conspiracy theorist, and thus intellectually lazy; your painting of the U.S as "black" against the "white" of supposedly victimized nations not only hypocritically strips away the very real political and international agency of all nations, but also serves as a proxy by which you can paint yourself as a victim of this system that, supposedly, has the power to bend entire nations to the "Machiavellian" designs of the U.S. In turn, since you are a "victim" of this "system," you can thus excuse any inaction on your part, and put all blame and responsibility regarding your socioeconomic standing on the shoulders of some entity that does not physically exist. Pathetic, really.
