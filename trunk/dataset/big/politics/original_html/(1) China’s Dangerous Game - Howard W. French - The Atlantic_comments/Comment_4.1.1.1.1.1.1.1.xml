	The majority of inter-state conflicts are resolved through negotiations and treaties. The statement is meaningless and misleading and mischaracterizes the substantive nature of the conflict itself by focusing on a pointless digression. How many negotiations *aren't* peaceful? I can't help but think that this is intentional obfuscation on your part.
