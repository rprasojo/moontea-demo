	I was on Palawan in May. I spent a lot of time there as a matter of fact. I did not see any Korean, Vietnamese or Chinese signs anywhere. I'm sure there must have been a few I did not notice, but nothing like the author claims. The "rickshaws" he is talking about are called trikes, and they are ubiquitous in the Philippines.

I'm assuming the author is simply making this up to add to spice to his story.
