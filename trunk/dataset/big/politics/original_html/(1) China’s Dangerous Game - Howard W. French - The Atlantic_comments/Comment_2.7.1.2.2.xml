	As some other commenters have correctly pointed out, America was (as usual) the aggressor in every one of these conflicts, although to be fair about it these are mostly in the past (unless you count America's disgraceful record, up to the current day, in Latin America).

I resent charges of "whataboutism". In no way, shape or form am I defending all of China's actions (although I DO defend some of them) -- what I'm doing is simply pointing out the rank hypocrisy of the world's #1 imperialist, militarist aggressor nation -- specifically the United States -- sitting there whining about "nasty, 'aggressive' old China", for the "outrage" of trying to dominate the South CHINA Sea. To be able to spew propaganda like this with a straight face is a uniquely American attribute, given that your own country has a much, MUCH worse track record of illegally interfering in the domestic affairs of countries literally around the world -- whereas China's similar "offenses", if any, lie only in the future.

Oh, and I suppose, anybody who calls out American nonsense propaganda and hypocrisy, must be a "paid stooge" of those who you hate (in this case, I assume that's China)... do I have that right? Well go stuff yourself. I work for nobody but myself, as if that needed to be said.

So who do YOU work for, my jingoistic American friend? C_A, N_A, F_I or just the Tupelo, Mississippi, Dog Catcher's Department?
