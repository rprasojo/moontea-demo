	Yes, that same Law of the Sea Convention. The one that the U.S. Navy still adheres to in spite of Congress's unwillingness to ratify. And let's not forget America's adherence to the San Remo Manual and the Hague Convention of 1907, the latter of which China violates to a dangerous degree with its development of offensive sea mines. Say what you will about American ground operations, but in terms of our naval policy, we do more to uphold international norms than any other nation. China is so far outside of the international consensus it's not even funny.
