	What rose-colored glasses you see the world through...

You are aware that both Xinjiang and Tibet are limited police states with the vast majority of the police and government posts being manned by Han Chinese and the Uighurs and Tibetans being treated as a distrusted and oppressed enemy by the police and army?

You are aware that economic development in these two regions is concentrated among the Han settlers and their descendants, to the point where most of Xinjiang's impressive economic growth over the last fifteen years hasn't made it to the people who lived there fifteen years ago?

I've been to Xinjiang and had friends go to Tibet; things are not so perfect as you want to delude yourself into believing.

I realize that China has legitimate security concerns that essentially require them to exercise control over the two regions, but if they want to do so they should at least treat the people who live there with a bare modicum of decency, which they currently do not do to any great extent. Talking about their "affirmative action" programs is like talking about putting a band-aid over the wound of a gunshot victim.
