	And you forgot to mention facts that all Chinese possessions in the South China Sea were resulted from recent invasions (Paracel/1974, 8 Spratly/ 1988, Mischief/1995 and Scarborough/2013) or China never controlled anything. So much for the fiction of Chinese historical ownership of SCS dated back to 1,000+ years.
