	1) This was a by the numbers recitation of the conventional wisdom. This article includes exactly one fact I -- a moderately interested layman -- didn't already know. Well, maybe two: I had no idea Vietnamese diplomats could be so droll.

2) If the U.S. is going to have alliances in the region, we best be ready to throw down for them. Strategic ambiguity won't work wrt China.

If we're willing to go to war to protect the Philippines, or Taiwan, or Japan then we need to be loud and clear about it; if we're not, then we shouldn't leave anyone with that impression.

Being seen as guaranteeing another nation's security when we're not willing to actually do it is a lose/lose position.

3) This is reason 663 to not treat China like a regular country. This is a country that executes political prisoners to harvest their organs. China should be facing the sort of sanctions usually associated with Iran, North Korea, and Saddam's Iraq.

That whole 'constructive engagement' approach is a huge failure (unless of course one supposes it's real purpose was to provide cover for companies seeking to make money by trading with China. And by trading with I mean exploiting the cheap labor supply. In that case it was a total success).
