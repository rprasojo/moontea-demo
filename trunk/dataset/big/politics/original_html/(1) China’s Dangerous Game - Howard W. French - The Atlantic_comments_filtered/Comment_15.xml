	The American and Japanese forces used to be large in West Pacific, but now they are small. It is not that the US and Japan got shrunk, it is the other side that grew bigger. The only way to have peace is to have Western forces large enough to reliably deter aggression. This is not easy considering that China is much larger than the US in human resources and roughly the same size economically. Small countries when threatened rely on universal draft, which gives them large reserves in case of need. Asia would be much more peaceful if American reservists were coming there once a year with reserve ships and aircraft to train and check what is going on there.
