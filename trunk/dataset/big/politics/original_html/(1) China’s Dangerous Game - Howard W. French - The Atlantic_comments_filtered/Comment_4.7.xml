	What a bunch of rubbish. Long claimed ? The Philippines has given dozens of examples of those islands never being claimed. The only major survey done of them by a chinese dynasty was done by Kublai Khan, a mongol who at the time had had conquered Korea, was invading Vietnam, was getting ready to invade Japan (stopped by the Kamakazi..divine wind), and wanted to see what else was out there to lay his hands on.

Besides that, it was a Nationalist Chinese Cartographer who whimsically put the 9-dash line on a 1946 map he was drawing. That is the strength of the Chinese claim. They had no settlements on the island, and it was Vietnamese, Malay, and Filipino fisherman and traders more than Chinese who plied these waters over the last 3000 years.

As far as the last 40 years... that number was put in place since it allows for the following not to be mentioned...

The Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949 The Chinese invasion of South Korea in 1950 Armed conflict with Taiwan over Matsu and Quemoy in 1958/59 The Chinese invasion of India in 1962 The Amur River conflict in 1969 The disastrous 1979 invasion of South Vietnam Now..they are close to conflict with Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan.

Yes... throughout their 65 year history, the Chinese have been a beacon of peace.
