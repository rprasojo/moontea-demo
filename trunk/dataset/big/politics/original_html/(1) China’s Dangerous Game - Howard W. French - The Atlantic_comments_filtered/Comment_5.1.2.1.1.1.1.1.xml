	Not all Guest posts are mine. I made the smart a$$ reply, "Thank you, um...honored guest." but I didn't type "Well stated Duncan..." Geez, how egomaniacal do you think I am?

Don't answer that please.

[edit, wait a minute, are you seeing both PW and my reply to him as Guest also? I'm just curious if Disqus is so buggy it's showing Guest to one user and not another. For reference, PW starts: "I'm not so sure. Tell all the Africans..." and my reply "I certainly wouldn't say that China has.." Those are the two posts above Manny Chen's. If you're seeing those as "done by a poster named 'Guest', too." then Disqus is even more messed up than I thought.
