	This is highly inaccurate and biased. Unlike Russia, China has for a very long time claimed much of these areas. Russia voluntarily gave up Crimea in the 70s but has unilaterally reclaimed it. These areas that China and its neighbors claim are considered disputed territory within international law unlike Crimea which has been Ukrainian autonomous region for more than 40 years.

Second, some historical context. China has more land borders with other countries than any country in the world and because of that fact one of the most territorial disputes historically. It has resolved almost all of them (except with India) peacefully through negotiation. That is unprecedented as most territorial disputes are resolved militarily.

China's so called aggression in the S. China seas today is actually a tit for tat strategy when their negotiation offers have been rebuffed and they have come under aggressive behavior from its neighbors (such as when Japan allowed the government to buy a disputed island or Vietnam's aggressive naval actions). Remember, Japan didn't even consider the Islands China also claims to be disputed territory until last year. There was and probably still is no hope of negotiation.

Third, according to a study by the political scientist Joshua Goldstein, China is the most peaceful of all major military powers in the last 40 years.

So the odds of war, though bigger than most people imagine in these territorial disputes, may not necessarily be due to Chinese aggression as this and almost all other articles in the western press suggest.
