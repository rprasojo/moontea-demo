	International norms have changed since the 19th century. The 19th and 20th Century imperial powers (which included an enthusiastic Japan) caused such chaos and suffering that they themselves created a newer, better order. China doesn't need to prove, again, that aggressive colony building and military adventurism are destructive. We have enough of a reminder of that from the US as it is (but the US doesn't attempt territorial expansion, for whatever that's worth).
