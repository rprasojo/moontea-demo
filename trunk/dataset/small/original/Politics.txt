LONDON -- Britain is under 72 hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime vote on Scottish independence that could break up the 307-year-old United Kingdom, splitting apart one of America’s key global allies. With polls suggesting that a Scottish split from the rest of Britain is a real possibility, lawmakers including Prime Minister David Cameron are making urgent appeals to save Britain its biggest constitutional upheaval since the War of Independence that led to the creation of the United States.

What will be voted on?

More than 4.2 million people in Scotland -- or 97 percent of the adult population -- have registered to vote on whether or not to remain part of the United Kingdom.

Scotland was an independent country until 1707, when the Act of Union with England led to the creation of Great Britain and, ultimately, the United Kingdom -- which also includes Northern Ireland and Wales.

It retained its own separate legal and education systems and was granted its own devolved parliament in Edinburgh in 1999 but control of defense, borders and taxation remain with the U.K. parliament in London’s Westminster and ultimate authority lies with Queen Elizabeth II.

Britain's government agreed to recognize the referendum, gambling that a likely 'No' vote would kill off the issue of Scottish independence for decades. But with polls now putting a 'Yes' vote within reach, the U.K. faces the serious prospect of a break-up.

Why does Scotland’s independence vote matter to America?

The White House says Thursday’s poll is “an internal matter” for Britain, but there are good reasons why the United States is nervous that one of its key global allies could be about to break apart.

Chief among these is the future of the joint U.S. and U.K. nuclear deterrent system. Scotland is home to 58 U.S. Trident II D-5 missiles leased from Washington by the British government, but Scotland’s government wants to ban nuclear weapons on moral grounds within four years of gaining independence. That could force London to relocate the weapons to alternative bases in England or return the weapons to the U.S., costing billions of dollars and leaving NATO without a European nuclear deterrent precisely at a time of heightened security concern.

An independent Scotland would have its own defense force and would likely remain an American ally, but any weakening of Britain’s defense capability would be a worry for the Pentagon. In January, former U.S. defense secretary Robert Gates said cuts in defense spending were already threatening Britain’s “ability to be a full partner.” Almost 30 members of Congress have signed a resolution calling for the U.K. to remain united, saying it was “important for U.S. national security priorities in Europe and around the world.”

Britain’s relationship with the European Union could also be under threat in the event of Scottish independence. Without Scotland’s phalanx of left-leaning Labour lawmakers, Westminster would likely be dominated by David Cameron’s Conservative Party, which favors a referendum on British withdrawal from the E.U.

How likely is Scotland to become independent?

Within two generations, Scottish independence has gone from an eccentric fringe movement to a dominant political force that is on the cusp of victory.

Until last month, the pro-Union Better Together ‘No’ campaign enjoyed a consistent and comfortable lead in opinion polls but a sudden surge in support for the pro-independence ‘Yes’ side has all but eliminated the gap. A “poll of polls” published by ScotCen on Monday puts ‘No’ at 51 percent and ‘Yes’ just two points behind, at 49 percent. “In a vote where the winning side needs 50% + 1 of votes cast, it is clear that neither side can now be completely confident of victory,” the research organization said.

A major YouGov poll last week gave the ‘Yes’ side a slim majority, spooking the global markets and causing the pound sterling to sink by 1.3 percent on foreign exchange markets before recovering. British lawmakers, who previously vowed to stay out of Scotland’s national debate, have been making urgent visits to Scotland to implore voters to save the United Kingdom.

What is the case for independence?

The ‘Yes’ campaign is led by First Minister Alex Salmond, whose Scottish National Party has governed since 2007. It says Scots should have total control of their own affairs and that revenue from Scotland’s offshore oil fields would sustain the country’s economy. Support for independence was boosted by the election in 2010 of a Conservative British government, angering voters in Scotland where the Conservative party remains deeply unpopular.

What is the case for keeping the United Kingdom?

The ‘No’ campaign says and independent Scotland would be weaker on the world stage and would have to raise taxes to pay for the replication of institutions and services currently shared with England, such as defense forces and state pensions. Many cross-border businesses have warned that they might withdraw from Scotland in the event of independence, threatening jobs.

For the United States, the pros and cons are naturally about strategic interests. “On the one hand, it is perfectly reasonable for Washington to assert its own interests by continuing a relationship with Westminster it heavily dominates,” said Jonathan Sher, a charity director from North Carolina who has also applied for dual citizenship and has publicly backed the ‘Yes’ side. “On the other hand, it is just as reasonable for Scotland to pursue its own interests in what will inevitably remain a friendly set of connections with America. Profound family, historical, musical, academic and trading ties between my two nations provide a firm foundation upon which we can and will build.”

How star-studded has the campaign been?

Edinburgh-born James Bond actor Sean Connery has been a decades-long supporter of Scottish independence, alongside Gerard Butler ("The Bounty Hunter"), Brian Cox ("The Bourne Supremacy," "Braveheart") and Alan Cumming ("The Good Wife"). Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood has also said a ‘Yes’ vote would be "great.”

Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling donated £1 million ($1.6 million) to the ‘No’ campaign, publicly declaring that Scotland would be stronger within the U.K. Other high-profile Better Together backers include actors Helena Bonham Carter, Patrick Stewart and Judi Dench as well as England soccer star David Beckham. The former Manchester United and L.A. Galaxy star said Monday that "what unites us is much greater than what divides us.”

What would an independent Scotland look like?

Scotland’s 5.3 million citizens represent about eight percent of the total U.K. population and would create a new country bigger than Ireland (4.5 million) but smaller than Denmark (5.5 million).

Its global economic position would depend greatly on what share of offshore oil revenue would be negotiated with the remainder of the U.K. – and how long that oil would last. The Scottish National Party believes lower corporate taxes would encourage investment and would allow Scotland to lower its reliance on oil in the longer term.

What would happen to the queen?

The Scottish National Party plans to keep the monarchy allowing Queen Elizabeth II to remain Queen of Scotland just as she is also queen of other British Commonwealth countries such as Canada and Australia.

She has not formally expressed an opinion on independence, but told a member of public on Sunday that she hoped voters “think very carefully about the future” in Thursday’s poll. She was speaking in Scotland, where she spends several weeks of the year at her summer retreat, Balmoral Castle.

Would Scotland immediately become independent on Friday?

No. The referendum has no direct legal power, but the British government has promised to negotiate Scotland’s split from the United Kingdom in the event of a ‘Yes’ victory, with an official split slated for March 2016. Unlike the United States, the U.K. does not have a written constitution - its political institutions and systems have evolved over the centuries – and so the re-creation of an independent Scotland would be uncharted territory. Scotland’s government wants to keep the pound sterling by forming a currency union tied to the Bank of England. However, Britain’s Treasury chief George Osborne has warned that the rest of the U.K. may not agree to such a deal – leaving an independent Scotland to bring in its own currency.

Scotland would also have to renegotiate its membership of the European Union. Its government remains confident that it would still meet all the criteria for membership after March 2016, but it could face tough opposition, most notably from Spain which is seeking to thwart the ambitions of an independence movement in Catalonia.

What happens if Scotland votes ‘No’?

No matter what happens, Scotland’s relationship with the rest of the U.K. will change. In a last-ditch attempt to persuade Scots to vote ‘No’, Cameron last week promised future extra powers for Scotland’s existing devolved parliament if Scots chose to vote 'No'. However, this olive branch may be too late to change Thursday’s result; Cameron had rejected extra powers as a middle-way option on the ballot paper, gambling that most voters would choose 'No' if given a straight Yes/No question on independence. Offering more devolved government at such a late stage has been dismissed by the ‘Yes’ side as a panic measure.

And whatever the outcome, the 18-month campaign has left social divisions as supporters on both sides trading acrimonious barbs over social media using the hashtag #indyref. Thursday’s poll has become a topic to avoid in bars and family gatherings. Fiona Scott, whose father taught Salmond at school, wrote in an open letter to The Herald newspaper on Saturday that the referendum “has succeeded in creating divisions across Scotland that were not there before and will still exit after the referendum, no matter which way the vote goes.” She added: "Relationships between neighbors are now threatened if you indicate which way you are voting."

The United Kingdom wouldn't be completely dead. UK would still be England, Wales and Northern Ireland, right? I say let the Scots have their true freedom.

While the idea of an independent Scotland appeals to me greatly in theory, on a practical level it's not a useful thing. The costs will simply be too great. As part of the UK, Scotland is part of a large and diversified economy. On its own, it's too heavily dependent on things like oil and tourism. Oil might last for a while, but eventually it will dry up. And tourism is going to take a hit when people can't travel freely between Scotland and the rest of the British isles.

A work colleague of mine based in London who is from Scotland is worried she will be forced to return to Scotland should independence get the votes it needs. And she's hardly alone.

Let Scots have independence and prosper.
They will be free from King/Queen too.

The United Kingdom would be dead. Because UK means the uniting of the English and Scottish kingdoms. Great Britain, however, has a broader meaning: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The headline had it wrong. Great Britain will continue to exist for a very long time (ie. Wales ain't going anywhere, that's for sure).

So if the people of Scotland vote for independence from England, will Obama put sanctions on Scotland and give military equipment and money to England like he did with Crimea's vote for independence from Ukraine? Will Obama threaten Scotland? Will Obama send US ships to cruise off the coast of Scotland? Will McCain and Graham go to London and support England in this issue and say Scotland cannot leave Great Britain? I am sure Obama is a man of honor and not two faced and is not just out to punish Putin and Russia for not letting gays hijack the Olympics, so Scotland will get sanctions. I mean the US is nothing if not honorable and fair. LOL

The Queen's role (and that of the Commonwealth) is symbolic and ceremonial; neither she nor the government in the UK can propose, change, or block any laws in Australia.  Like Brisbar stated - similar situation in many other countries like Canada and New Zealand.
I don't doubt that there are citizens of (all similar) countries that resent the "idea" of the monarchy and would like to see all vestiges of it removed (eg: from currency).  (You could probably find a ton of those people in Quebec.)  At the end of the day it would change almost nothing - a few ceremonies like the opening Parliament, the pictures on currency, etc, etc.

Scotland deserves to be independent. They are no worse than English and can run their own country.

Comment #8

For over 300 years the English has bled the Scots of their natural and financial resources. And foolishly the courageous Scotland Highland Regiment fought bravely in almost every war to preserve the English Crown despite living under the British thumb.
It's bloody high time for the Scots to fight for their own independence than for the British Crown.

Scotland, as picturesque as it may seem to a tourist, has very little else going for it. Big companies, and some larger banks, have said they'll move to England if Scotland becomes 'independent'. The Scots are proud of their country, no doubt, but these days nobody can live on that only. Those who have been campaigning for independence have simply not thought it through. Scotland has a very high unemployment rate and in order for that country to exist, they all must pull together and start creating jobs. If not, Scotland will just have to go hat in hand and beg for international assistance like most Third World countries do. And that is nothing to be proud of.

I lived in Scotland for two years in the mid 80's, high temp. 72f. but that's beside the point, there was talk of separation then. One of the main themes was that Scotland provided income to England to spend on its own issues without regard to the Scottish people. Dunoon was brilliant with some very good and decent people. I do hope that whatever they support will work out for the Scots.

=======================================================================================================

I think Scotland gets far more than they give.  The population there is not very big to support a defense and basic government services. Yes, they'll get some oil money, but not all.  And North Sea pumping rates are declining.  Even they know they'll have to diversify.
If they vote to secede thinking they'll get to keep more money, I think they'll be surprised.

I think Scotland should just stay with The United Kingdom. Why do countries want to get smaller? It makes you weaker to be smaller and rate now it would seem with radical Muslims and Russian being aggressive that it would be a very bad time to divide and get smaller. I was kind of hoping to see a untied Europe but I guess with Scotland not wanting it that it will never happen. Well whatever the decision I hope everyone still supports them and people can get along.

=======================================================================================================

I am wondering if all this has anything to do with the fact that the UK has been swarmed by Muslim immigration?  The article said that the pro-EU sorts were mainly in Scotland.  They have been stuck with this immigration swarm due to EU policy.  England would be able to dump the EU if Scotland leaves perhaps, and then they could kick out the Muslims and get their country back.  Perhaps it is good riddance?  So in some weird way, perhaps it is this EU stuff that is breaking up a union that is over 300 years old.  Just wondering.

If Scotland splits, it will give Tories a huge advantage, making Scotland way more leftist.

Comment #15

The current UK is only about the size of Minnesota, yet a part of that tiny country is about to break away.  Will Luxembourg break apart too, say, into North Luxembourg and South Luxembourg?  The breakup is a mistake that will lead to security and economic weakness for everyone in the UK.  Ridiculous!

It appears that the separatist movement in Scotland is a lot like the T-Party movement in the USA. The changes to the world that are a result of the globalization that started with Columbus and are under nobody's control are frustrating folks into thinking they can point a finger at somebody and everything will be OK. We need to move together with common goals, not apart with selfishness.

=======================================================================================================
Comment #17

Perhaps in Scotland they still believe their votes matter. In the US elections are bought, legislators are bought, issues are bought, and we have a war industry to support for crying out loud. Scotland has no war industry and so the politics is more real I would guess.
In the US if 100 percent of us voted in a completely new government nothing would change. We are ruled by a ruler somewhere.

Unlike the American colonies, Scotland has representation in Parliament and substantial amount of control over its internal affairs.  You can't compare Scotland in 2014 to the colonies in 1776.

=======================================================================================================
Comment #19

While independence was a great idea for the colonies, was not such a great idea for the Southern states during our civil war, lol. 
The question that might be asked - is it necessary for the people to Scotland to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with the UK? I have yet to see much by way of grievances listed by Scotland that would justify such a move.  Seems more based on sentimental reasons, and I'm not sure that's justification for separation.  But since I don't live there, and since the UK agreed to abide by the vote, is a moot point.  Scotland will have their say on it, regardless.  Hope they choose wisely.

This will send both Scotland and UK into economic turmoil.
