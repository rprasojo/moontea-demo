Orlando Bloom v Justin Bieber: history's most pathetic celebrity scuffle
Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber engaged in embarrassing fisticuffs earlier this week over Miranda Kerr, but what they're really fighting for is their waning careers

It's the question that has divided the world. Permanently destroyed friendships. Condemned families to generations of icily silent Christmas dinners together. The question, the all-important question, is this: are you Team Orlando Bloom or Team Justin Bieber?

After gossip site TMZ released a grainy, rubbernecking video of Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber engaging in some minor-level fisticuffs at a restaurant in Ibiza this week, people have been lining up to proudly state their allegiances. On Team Bloom is James Franco, who came out in support of his fellow actor on the US satire show The Colbert Report this week; and Leonardo DiCaprio, who allegedly cheered Bloom on from his table inside the restaurant. And on Team Bieber is ...

Well, fine, nobody's on Team Bieber. Why would they be? Bieber, who is rumoured to have got close to Bloom's then-wife Miranda Kerr in 2012, appeared to instigate the restaurant fight by yelling "What's up, bitch?", and then immediately scarpered away to Instagram photos of Kerr wearing a bikini and Bloom crying. It's crystalline obnoxiousness. It's gold-plated villainy.

To borrow a well-worn Guardian phrase, Justin Bieber is peak brat.

But you have to pick a side, because the stakes couldn't be higher for either of them. Orlando Bloom is fighting for nothing less than his dignity, and Justin Bieber is fighting for the bragging rights to say that he's marginally tougher than the Helen Flanagan look-alike from The Hobbit.

Most importantly, they're both fighting to salvage their waning careers. Justin Bieber hasn't released a truly popular song since the one about babies that he recorded back when he looked like a foetus sitting underneath an Afghan Hound, and Orlando Bloom knows that his career will all but dry up as soon as Peter Jackson runs out of ways to wring JRR Tolkien's corpse dry.

In that respect, their fight has an unmistakably tragic Whatever Happened to Baby Jane quality to it. It's hard to think of a more pathetic celebrity scuffle. Perhaps the only real precedent is the fight that took place between Kid Rock and Motley Crue's Tommy Lee at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards over Pamela Anderson, to whom they were both at one time married. Like Bloom v Bieber, it was a scrappy, embarrassing almost-fight between two preening dunderheads whose best days are behind them. And, like Bloom v Bieber, nobody won. Especially not humanity.

In defence of Orlando Bloom, he is pretty, and that is reason enough for me to watch his films. Besides, most of them are actually entertaining, so I don't know what the complaints are about. Isn't it his job to make entertaining films? And there's plenty of people who aren't fantastic actors but still get put in films for their name/looks. At least he seems relatively inoffensive. Except to Bieber, obviously, and that can be forgiven.

Reminds me of an episode of the Simpsons... "How many of you are thinking of punching Bieber right now? Be honest!"

I googled Miranda Kerr after reading this and I got to say Orlando is a bigger sucker for marrying that woman. She is ok for whatever Bieber had going on with her but to marry her?

Ibiza is the undisputed world dumpster during the Summer... Football players and their illiterate girlfriends, russian gangsters, bullfighters and now Justin Bieber! Not even the zoo has such a variety.

How Bieber hasn't had the absolute shite kicked out of him is a miracle. It will happen in time though...be patient. I remember that little turd Liam Gallagher (who I admit is infinitely more talented but still a world class twat nonetheless) take on some punters in a hotel in Italy (if Im not mistaken). He was shortly afterwards picking up his teeth from the floor.

Bloom is a terrible actor, but christ i'd like to see his elfness beat the s**t out of that goblin. The picture above of Bieber alone makes me want to go Rocky Balboa on him.

Maybe Bloom is recyclable after the finale of "Lord of the Rings"; on the other hand, Bieber is just toxic garbage.

Bieber is 20 so practically a child still and one who has grown up mostly in the artificial fish bowl of celebrity. Bloom is 37 and a father of a small child. Surely Bloom could have shown some restrain and/or dignity instead of throwing the world's most feeble punch. In times of stress shouldn't celebrities be asking themselves what would George Clooney do?

Bloom should have been able to do some damage to Bieber as he's had some fight training but sadly it appears that he ignored any lessons he'd learn and just flailed away pathetically at Bieber.
Bloom need to get some real combat training and hunt down Bieber for a full on arse kicking. He should bring some back up in case Bieber has a posse of goons with him plus a 2 man film crew to document the fight. Then he can sell the footage of Bieber getting the shit kicked out of him. It'll make millions!

Personally, I think Miranda Kerr is getting more mileage from this farce than either Bloom or Bieber. Bloom is tolerable and may even reach a point where he can actually act...he still has a career in front of him. Kerr and Bieber probably deserve each other...after all...in the shallow world of the catwalk, her use by date has come and gone...and Bieber's fan base has grown up by now and has achieved a level of taste that has no doubt surpassed his bopper pap.

Anybody who doesn't consider Bloom a 'real' actor, check out Kingdom of Heaven. Way overdone and not adequately edited movie but in which Bloom was clearly the lead. Make sure you watch the Director's cut. It's a far, far superior film to what was released in cinemas and the only version in which Bloom's performance makes sense.

In general people will always be jealous of people with money. It's a fact of life. Even worse for someone like Justin, a 20 year old who has earned money that so many people on this site will never make in their entire lives. He has been given a talent that so many few on earth have and he has put in so much hard work that people commenting here wouldn't be able to do.

he's an inspiration to millions, including myself, and will continue to be. Justin Bieber is more famous than Orlando Bloom.

People commenting here are those who are middle age and have nothing else to achieve in life. For them they can't understand how a kid could have money that they could only dream of and it's likely that their kids will never have such.
People on here are bitter.

I first saw Orlando Bloom in the first Pirates movie. He was very pretty, but not much of an actor. And of course, he was overshadowed by Johnny Depp. As he gets older, he will have to work much harder, and I hope he makes it. I have heard of Justin Bieber but never heard him sing, and am told by my grandchildren that he isn't very good.

Bieber is only 20. I can accept some of his brattish behaviour but on this occasion Bloom was right in punching him. He was cussing the mother of his child. No man would stand for that.

I live in Canada but think that Justin Bieber is a spoiled brat with no talent. Orlando Bloom has appeared in numerous movies and is much prettier than the brat. I am on the blooming side.

The question forefront in my mind is 'What on earth would Miranda Kerr see in Justin Bieber?' I mean, not only does he wear baseball caps that a re too big for him (a la Brian Harvey) but he also wears his hoodie hood over them.
I'm just looking forward to the point at which Bieber is reduced to appearing in Sharknado 5. With Orlando Bloom as his co-star probably.

Is it just me, or is Leonardo DiCaprio gradually becoming Jack Nicholson? I mean this quite literally; are they replacing pieces of Nicholson with various cybernetic solutions, renovating the original pieces and installing them in DiCaprio? What they do with the displaced pieces of DiCaprio, I could only speculate. I am willing to speculate, though, and I think that they are possibly keeping said pieces as spares.
I mean, in my mind's eye, cheering Orlando on is exactly what Nicholson would do. It would please me immensely to have this confirmed.

Celebrities have to have their headlines, on a sustained basis.
So every once in awhile, 2 celebrities agree among themselves to have a feud. The rest of the world thinks it's a real feud, and gobbles up all the stories about the feud. And the celebrities have their headlines, so they benefit, and they usually make up in the end.
Of course there may be real feuds among celebrities as well... but there's no way of telling, not anymore. But this one, with two celebrities who are in dire need of some headlines... it may well be a fake feud. And a very successful one.

Bloom is a disgrace and should apologise forthwith. Bieber is a world class talent; the thought of Bloom damaging his voicebox with a stray punch brings me out in a cold sweat. Bieber's voice is a blessing to the human race from God. May Bloom burn in hell

As I understand it, Bieber indulged in some pubescent needling with regard to the mother of Bloom's child and Bloom lamped him. Though not hard enough, apparently. Then Bieber indulged in what passes for l'esprit de l'escalier these days by continuing his brattery on Twitter.
Bloom's appeared prominently in eight, soon - inevitably - to be nine, of the highest-grossing films in cinema history. No, he's not the finest actor of his generation, but he must be doing something right. I don't imagine he worries about his future too much.
Whereas Bieber... Well, it's not going to end well, is it? Another manchild monster heading for something grim, all in the service of clickbait.
