In defence of Orlando Bloom, Orlando Bloom is pretty, and that is reason enough for me to watch Orlando Bloom's films. Besides, most of films are actually entertaining, so I don't know what the complaints are about. Isn't it Orlando Bloom's job to make entertaining films? And there's plenty of people who aren't fantastic actors but still get put in films for their name/looks. At least he seems relatively inoffensive. Except to Justin Bieber, obviously, and that can be forgiven.

Reminds me of an episode of the Simpsons... "How many of you are thinking of punching Justin Bieber right now? Be honest!"

I googled Miranda Kerr after reading this and I got to say Orlando Bloom is a bigger sucker for marrying that woman. She is ok for whatever Justin Bieber had going on with her but to marry her?

Ibiza is the undisputed world dumpster during the Summer... Football players and their illiterate girlfriends, russian gangsters, bullfighters and now Justin Bieber! Not even the zoo has such a variety.

How Justin Bieber hasn't had the absolute shite kicked out of him is a miracle. It will happen in time though...be patient. I remember that little turd Liam Gallagher (who I admit is infinitely more talented but still a world class twat nonetheless) take on some punters in a hotel in Italy (if Im not mistaken). He was shortly afterwards picking up his teeth from the floor.

Orlando Bloom is a terrible actor, but christ i'd like to see his elfness beat the s**t out of that goblin. The picture above of Justin Bieber alone makes me want to go Rocky Balboa on him.

Maybe Orlando Bloom is recyclable after the finale of "Lord of the Rings"; on the other hand, Justin Bieber is just toxic garbage.

Comment 8

Justin Bieber is 20 so practically a child still and one who has grown up mostly in the artificial fish bowl of celebrity. Orlando Bloom is 37 and a father of a small child. Surely Orlando Bloom could have shown some restrain and/or dignity instead of throwing the world's most feeble punch. In times of stress shouldn't celebrities be asking themselves what would George Clooney do?

Orlando Bloom should have been able to do some damage to Justin Bieber as he's had some fight training but sadly it appears that he ignored any lessons he'd learn and just flailed away pathetically at Justin Bieber.
Orlando Bloom need to get some real combat training and hunt down Justin Bieber for a full on arse kicking. He should bring some back up in case Justin Bieber has a posse of goons with him plus a 2 man film crew to document the fight. Then he can sell the footage of Justin Bieber getting the shit kicked out of him. It'll make millions!

Personally, I think Miranda Kerr is getting more mileage from this farce than either Orlando Bloom or Justin Bieber. Orlando Bloom is tolerable and may even reach a point where he can actually act...he still has a career in front of him. Miranda Kerr and Justin Bieber probably deserve each other...after all...in the shallow world of the catwalk, her use by date has come and gone...and Justin Bieber's fan base has grown up by now and has achieved a level of taste that has no doubt surpassed his bopper pap.

Anybody who doesn't consider Orlando Bloom a 'real' actor, check out Kingdom of Heaven. Way overdone and not adequately edited movie but in which Orlando Bloom was clearly the lead. Make sure you watch the Director's cut. It's a far, far superior film to what was released in cinemas and the only version in which Orlando Bloom's performance makes sense.

In general people will always be jealous of people with money. It's a fact of life. Even worse for someone like Justin Bieber, a 20 year old who has earned money that so many people on this site will never make in their entire lives. He has been given a talent that so many few on earth have and he has put in so much hard work that people commenting here wouldn't be able to do.

he's an inspiration to millions, including myself, and will continue to be. Justin Bieber is more famous than Orlando Bloom.

People commenting here are those who are middle age and have nothing else to achieve in life. For them they can't understand how a kid could have money that they could only dream of and it's likely that their kids will never have such.
People on here are bitter.

I first saw Orlando Bloom in the first Pirates movie. He was very pretty, but not much of an actor. And of course, he was overshadowed by Johnny Depp. As he gets older, he will have to work much harder, and I hope he makes it. I have heard of Justin Bieber but never heard him sing, and am told by my grandchildren that he isn't very good.

Justin Bieber is only 20. I can accept some of his brattish behaviour but on this occasion Orlando Bloom was right in punching him. He was cussing the mother of his child. No man would stand for that.

I live in Canada but think that Justin Bieber is a spoiled brat with no talent. Orlando Bloom has appeared in numerous movies and is much prettier than the brat. I am on the blooming side.

Comment 16

The question forefront in my mind is 'What on earth would Miranda Kerr see in Justin Bieber?' I mean, not only does he wear baseball caps that a re too big for him (a la Brian Harvey) but he also wears his hoodie hood over them.
I'm just looking forward to the point at which Justin Bieber is reduced to appearing in Sharknado 5. With Orlando Bloom as his co-star probably.

Is it just me, or is Leonardo DiCaprio gradually becoming Jack Nicholson? I mean this quite literally; are they replacing pieces of Nicholson with various cybernetic solutions, renovating the original pieces and installing them in Leonardo DiCaprio? What they do with the displaced pieces of Leonardo DiCaprio, I could only speculate. I am willing to speculate, though, and I think that they are possibly keeping said pieces as spares.
I mean, in my mind's eye, cheering Orlando Bloom on is exactly what Nicholson would do. It would please me immensely to have this confirmed.

Celebrities have to have their headlines, on a sustained basis.
So every once in awhile, 2 celebrities agree among themselves to have a feud. The rest of the world thinks it's a real feud, and gobbles up all the stories about the feud. And the celebrities have their headlines, so they benefit, and they usually make up in the end.
Of course there may be real feuds among celebrities as well... but there's no way of telling, not anymore. But this one, with two celebrities who are in dire need of some headlines... it may well be a fake feud. And a very successful one.


================================================================
Comment 19

Orlando Bloom is a disgrace and should apologise forthwith. Justin Bieber is a world class talent; the thought of Orlando Bloom damaging his voicebox with a stray punch brings me out in a cold sweat. Justin Bieber's voice is a blessing to the human race from God. May Orlando Bloom burn in hell

Comment 20

As I understand it, Justin Bieber indulged in some pubescent needling with regard to the mother of Orlando Bloom's child and Orlando Bloom lamped him. Though not hard enough, apparently. Then Justin Bieber indulged in what passes for l'esprit de l'escalier these days by continuing his brattery on Twitter.
Orlando Bloom's appeared prominently in eight, soon - inevitably - to be nine, of the highest-grossing films in cinema history. No, he's not the finest actor of his generation, but he must be doing something right. I don't imagine he worries about his future too much.
Whereas Justin Bieber... Well, it's not going to end well, is it? Another manchild monster heading for something grim, all in the service of clickbait.
