Is there a risk to vaccinating children? Yes there is, a very, very, very small risk. But then, there is a risk to any medical procedure, including having your blood pressure taken or taking an aspirin for a headache. The issue is, what is the cost/benefit ratio? Does a miniscule risk of a complication from, say, a polio vaccination, outweigh the risk of getting polio? If you say, "yes", you don't know much about polio.

I have been in a long Email correspondence with a physician who is now a Resident in Pediatrics in Tehran. I sent her a copy of this article and she was appalled by "Dr. Bob". She reports that when she was working in a rural public health clinic she had parents screaming at her weekly because basic vaccines weren't available. These people (and people all over the "third world") KNOW what the consequences of not vaccinating their children are - a high risk of perfectly preventable diseases. Dr. Paul Offitsubstantial number of highly spoiled Americans, for whom these diseases had been virtually wiped out by 2000, don't understand that they were wiped out through an aggressive program of immunization. These Americans are so spoiled that they are willing weaken the overall immunity in the population because of large amounts of crap they read on the Internet or other sources put out by conspiracy theorists, people who hate all government (and by extension the CDC) because "freedom", and compliant doctors who make a fortune from pandering to their spoiled patients' ill-informed fears.

Good luck to all of the unvaccinated when they visit Disney, or travel to Central America in high school for charity work, or study abroad in college anywhere in the world. There are a lot of immigrants from 3rd world countries in "safe" westernized countries and these little cute kids will be coming down with Measles, Polio, Whooping Cough, etc., as a young adult.

The US health system is ran like a business and is abysmal # 38 in the world. It is clear that there is no practical need to have 69 vaccinations on the schedule. Open your eyes - the schedule is driven first and foremost by pharma seeking guaranteed revenue stream. And pediatricians... It does not hurt their pockets either. There are no diseases on the schedule, except perhaps, polio, that a healthy child will not fully recover from. I don't mind my kids getting measles. What I do mind, is someone driven primarily by greed and vanity claiming to know what's best for them. Nothing good can ever develop out of it! I take my kids to dr sears and stand by him.

Just do a web search of William Thompson, Ph.D. He was a high-level executive of the CDC. He is now a Whistle blower even if inadvertently by being on the record as saying that not only does the CDC know that the MMR vaccinations cause autism; they also covered it up... Now why is it that the mainstream media - to include the LA Times - are not able to pick-up and/or cover this story. Dr. Paul Offitcouple of highlights: 1) "It appears the CDC was aware there was a risk of autism in connection with MMR vaccines as early as 2002, but chose to suppress that information from being made public." 2) While performing a full analysis of the CDCâ€™s own data, Hooker revealed in a published paper there was a 340 percent increased risk of autism in African American children after receiving the MMR vaccine.

The real problem here is that big pharma has proven over and over again to be untrustworthy, as have all the medical professionals who take honorariums, vacations disguised as seminars, and outright bribes in the form of money and expensive gifts from them. 

You can't trust big pharma, and now it seems you can trust fewer and fewer doctors. 

There's just too much money involved.

Comment 7

I commend Dr. Bob Sears for standing up for individual rights in the face of the public health establishment. Clearly he takes the Hippocratic oath seriously: "First, do no harm." He also believes in informed consent, which is what his books are all about. There are both risks and benefits to vaccines, and the establishment overemphasizes the benefits and downplays the risks. Hundreds of people are injured by vaccines every year; no one should be forced to vaccinate against their will. Mandatory vaccination privileges people who might be harmed by failure to vaccinate over people who might be harmed by vaccination.


================================================================
Comment 8

There is a definite correlation between the dramatic increase in auto immune disease and the relatively recent advent of mass immunization. 

However, as is the case with "climate change/global warming", causation is not proved by simple correlation, notwithstanding the rantings of Dr. Paul Offit Gore or false implications of Michael Mann's infamous hockey stick graph. 

That said, there are many studies underway trying to determine if there are unintended consequences to mass vaccination. I suspect that in some cases there are.


================================================================
Comment 9

Its too bad Paloma did not do any other research than talk to Dr. Dr. Paul Offit. Dr. Dr. Paul Offit is not a credible source as he profits in the millions of dollars from vaccines. Talk about a conflict of interest. If people would bother to look at the CDC's own data they will see that their belief in the efficacy of vaccines is not what we are brought to believe. There is no such thing as herd immunity. In fact its the kids that are not vaccinated that run a greater risk of contracting disease from vaccinated kids that are shedding virus cells for a period of time after vaccination. I am disappointed that once again parent who choose not to vaccinate are portrayed as kooks and are uneducated. I have spent years researching the subject. It is a personal decision either way. I pass no judgement. Dr. Sears is holding to his oath "First do no harm" Dr. Paul Offits who refuse to treat patients that don't conform to the Dr. Paul Offits personal beliefs should be ashamed of themselves. I am petrified that we will soon be living in a country where we have no choice in what is administered to us. Frankly, all the parents who run to the Dr. Paul Offitwhen their kid has a runny nose for antibiotics pose a much greater threat to the human race. Keep on asking for the Zpac...someday people will die of infection again. Shame on you LA Times...this piece is crap. What about the announcement by a former CDC Dr. Paul Offitlast week that admitted that the CDC fudged the numbers in a vaccine/autism study? Was that not worth looking at or at least mentioning in the article? 


================================================================
Comment 10

This disagreement over the study parameters is not a cover up, nor has it anything to do with CDC actions. It is a legitimate debate between authors as to methodology, and it occurs all of the time. The 240% increase in Dr. Paul Offit males is interesting, but is lacking a specific rational biological mechanism as to why race and gender would make a difference. Nor is it reflected in the actual stats om autism by race and gender where white males are 30% more likely to be diagnosed with autism than black males. This study result has also not been replicated in any other of the hundreds of studies showing that autism and MMR are not linked. 


================================================================
Comment 11

Part of the oath of physicians is do no harm. 
In his quest to find personal meaning and personal gratification and stroke his ego, this "doctor" does exactly the opposite, cause harm. 
This thinking is straight out of the everybody is special and everybody gets a trophy generation. It may not be good for public health, but for your child it's a safe choice? 
With that mindset he takes advantage of vulnerable and gullible parents and families. They are understandably afraid, confused etc. what's the alleged doctors excuse?


================================================================
Comment 12

Have you ever know someone that has mental/psychological issues that are controlled with medication? That person is going along just fine until one day, while taking said medications, decides that everything is fine and they don't need these medications any longer. But, of course, that person DOES need the medication to maintain a sane life. 

That is what this doctor is saying to these people that have SOUGHT OUT a doctor to tell them their crazy ideas are OK. He is justifying to them that the diseases are under control to a point that your kids are not at risk to the diseases if they don't vaccinate. Sounds a bit like the crazy person that decides they don't need the medication any longer doesn't it?


================================================================
Comment 13

It's idiots like this doctor (who should have his license pulled), yuppie scum parents who expect the herd to vaccinate, but not their useless spawn, and our complete lack of control of the southern border that's causing the epidemic we have today in diseases such as whooping cough. Polio is only a decade away with these sorts of idiots being allowed to practice so-called medicine.


================================================================
Comment 14

I post here again as a pediatrician whose practice area (in Tucson, Dr. Paul Offit) endured a pertussis outbreak thanks to the malpractice-level "advice" given by Sears in his "book" Continuing with the prior post, it was also one of Dr. Sear's own unvaccinated patients that started the 2008 San Diego County measles outbreak in another physician's office (http://www.ocregister.com/articles/http-548411-ocregister-href.html)). Finally, Sears himself admits in the second edition of his execrable "vaccine book" (published in 2011, page 46) that "...I sure do see my fair share of pertussis--at least 1 case each month. During the 2010 pertussis epidemic in California I saw several cases each month. And virtually all of these were in unvaccinated kids." Sears is clearly negligent and contributory to the outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in southern California. Why does he continue to do this. Several reasons, I believe. First, sheer arrogance--as in somehow his pedigree makes him smarter than the CDC (which he clearly is not). Second, his book sells well--it's made him a pretty penny. Third, Sears runs a cash-only practice and by getting parents to space out vaccines (if they vaccinate) he makes a lot more money off them. IMHO Sears deserves to have his license pulled by the Medical Board of California as he is a clear and present menace to public health who does not even come close to delivering the standard of care to his patients [please also see my other post on Sears--there is too much for just one comment] --Chris Hickie, MD, PhD

Comment 15

Dr. Bob was my children's pediatrician, he is a wonderful man and thoughtful doctor. The practice includes his father, brother, mother (nurse) and wife (nurse). Dr. Paul Offitvery loving and pro-child group. It is not a bunch of condescending, God complex doctors. The sit with parents and give them alternatives to the main stream, group think, medicine. I would recommend Dr. Sears "The Baby Book" to any parent, and have given it, as a gift to many friends. Their approach is much different than the article represents. Their approach is common sense, which many may paint as anti-science, but is more like asking your grandma. You all can take your Obama Care. I will stick with Dr. Bob. 
Good Luck!


================================================================
Comment 16

"Feelings" instead of rigorous science. This Dr. Bob seems like a charlatan: no evidence for his schedule being less of a risk to public health, therefore he shouldn't be recommending anything outside of the proven schedule of immunizations. 

Will he publish a scientific paper detailing the illnesses and deaths that ensue as a result of his medical recommendations? 


================================================================
Comment 17

His license should be pulled for public endangerment. This is like blowing through all way stops because you figure everybody else will stop.


================================================================
Comment 18

It's horrible for public health and this doctor if one can call him that is encouraging narcissistic parents to put their individual irrational fears over public health. 

He took the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. We'll he is doing harm to the public's health and other peoples kid's health. 

He should lose his license to practice medicine as he's basically advocating harming the many for the benefit of a few's irrational fears... 


================================================================
Comment 19

Part of this equation is an elitist mentality 
and those who cater to them. One can find any 
type of book to assuage their sense of knowing 
all. Some enjoy their sought out per group 
acceptence and attention.


================================================================
Comment 20

I regard the anti-vaccine types as a clear cut case of selection of the fittest. 

There is ZERO proof that vaccines cause autism. ZERO. But lack of them causes illness and death. That is 100% proven. 

You want to put your off spring at risk? Please do so, it would be best to eliminate the stupid genes from the pool.
