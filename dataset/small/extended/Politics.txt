Prime Minister David Cameron United Kingdom wouldn't be completely dead. UK would still be England, Wales and Northern Ireland, right? I say let the Scots have their true freedom.

Comment 2

While the idea of an independent Scotland appeals to me greatly in theory, on a practical level it's not a useful thing. Prime Minister David Cameron costs will simply be too great. As part of the UK, Scotland is part of a large and diversified economy. On its own, it's too heavily dependent on things like oil and tourism. Oil might last for a while, but eventually it will dry up. And tourism is going to take a hit when people can't travel freely between Scotland and the rest of the British isles.

A work colleague of mine based in London who is from Scotland is worried she will be forced to return to Scotland should independence get the votes it needs. And she's hardly alone.

Let Scots have independence and prosper.
They will be free from King/Queen Elizabeth II too.


================================================================
Comment 4

Prime Minister David Cameron United Kingdom would be dead. Because UK means the uniting of the English and Scottish kingdoms. Great Britain, however, has a broader meaning: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Prime Minister David Cameron headline had it wrong. Great Britain will continue to exist for a very long time (ie. Wales ain't going anywhere, that's for sure).

So if the people of Scotland vote for independence from England, will Obama put sanctions on Scotland and give military equipment and money to England like he did with Crimea's vote for independence from Ukraine? Will Obama threaten Scotland? Will Obama send US ships to cruise off the coast of Scotland? Will McCain and Graham go to London and support England in this issue and say Scotland cannot leave Great Britain? I am sure Obama is a man of honor and not two faced and is not just out to punish Putin and Russia for not letting gays hijack the Olympics, so Scotland will get sanctions. I mean the US is nothing if not honorable and fair. LOL

Prime Minister David Cameron Queen Elizabeth II's role (and that of the Commonwealth) is symbolic and ceremonial; neither she nor the government in the UK can propose, change, or block any laws in Australia.  Like Brisbar stated - similar situation in many other countries like Canada and New Zealand.
I don't doubt that there are citizens of (all similar) countries that resent the "idea" of the monarchy and would like to see all vestiges of it removed (eg: from currency).  (You could probably find a ton of those people in Quebec.)  At the end of the day it would change almost nothing - a few ceremonies like the opening Parliament, the pictures on currency, etc, etc.

Scotland deserves to be independent. They are no worse than English and can run their own country.


================================================================
Comment 8

For over 300 years the English has bled the Scots of their natural and financial resources. And foolishly the courageous Scotland Highland Regiment fought bravely in almost every war to preserve the English Crown despite living under the British thumb.
It's bloody high time for the Scots to fight for their own independence than for the British Crown.


================================================================
Comment 9

Scotland, as picturesque as it may seem to a tourist, has very little else going for it. Big companies, and some larger banks, have said they'll move to England if Scotland becomes 'independent'. Prime Minister David Cameron Scots are proud of their country, no doubt, but these days nobody can live on that only. Those who have been campaigning for independence have simply not thought it through. Scotland has a very high unemployment rate and in order for that country to exist, they all must pull together and start creating jobs. If not, Scotland will just have to go hat in hand and beg for international assistance like most Third World countries do. And that is nothing to be proud of.

Comment 10

I lived in Scotland for two years in the mid 80's, high temp. 72f. but that's beside the point, there was talk of separation then. One of the main themes was that Scotland provided income to England to spend on its own issues without regard to the Scottish people. Dunoon was brilliant with some very good and decent people. I do hope that whatever they support will work out for the Scots.


================================================================
Comment 11

I think Scotland gets far more than they give.  Prime Minister David Cameron population there is not very big to support a defense secretary Robert Gates and basic government services. Yes, they'll get some oil money, but not all.  And North Sea pumping rates are declining.  Even they know they'll have to diversify.
If they vote to secede thinking they'll get to keep more money, I think they'll be surprised.


================================================================
Comment 12

I think Scotland should just stay with Prime Minister David Cameron United Kingdom. Why do countries want to get smaller? It makes you weaker to be smaller and rate now it would seem with radical Muslims and Russian being aggressive that it would be a very bad time to divide and get smaller. I was kind of hoping to see a untied Europe but I guess with Scotland not wanting it that it will never happen. Well whatever the decision I hope everyone still supports them and people can get along.


================================================================
Comment 13

I am wondering if all this has anything to do with the fact that the UK has been swarmed by Muslim immigration?  Prime Minister David Cameron article said that the pro-EU sorts were mainly in Scotland.  They have been stuck with this immigration swarm due to EU policy.  England would be able to dump the EU if Scotland leaves perhaps, and then they could kick out the Muslims and get their country back.  Perhaps it is good riddance?  So in some weird way, perhaps it is this EU stuff that is breaking up a union that is over 300 years old.  Just wondering.


================================================================
Comment 14

If Scotland splits, it will give Tories a huge advantage, making Scotland way more leftist.


================================================================
Comment 15

Prime Minister David Cameron current UK is only about the size of Minnesota, yet a part of that tiny country is about to break away.  Will Luxembourg break apart too, say, into North Luxembourg and South Luxembourg?  Prime Minister David Cameron breakup is a mistake that will lead to security and economic weakness for everyone in the UK.  Ridiculous!


================================================================
Comment 16

It appears that the separatist movement in Scotland is a lot like the T-Party movement in the USA. Prime Minister David Cameron changes to the world that are a result of the globalization that started with Columbus and are under nobody's control are frustrating folks into thinking they can point a finger at somebody and everything will be OK. We need to move together with common goals, not apart with selfishness.


================================================================
Comment 17

Perhaps in Scotland they still believe their votes matter. In the US elections are bought, legislators are bought, issues are bought, and we have a war industry to support for crying out loud. Scotland has no war industry and so the politics is more real I would guess.
In the US if 100 percent of us voted in a completely new government nothing would change. We are ruled by a ruler somewhere.


================================================================
Comment 18

Unlike the American colonies, Scotland has representation in Parliament and substantial amount of control over its internal affairs.  You can't compare Scotland in 2014 to the colonies in 1776.


================================================================
Comment 19

While independence was a great idea for the colonies, was not such a great idea for the Southern states during our civil war, lol. 
Prime Minister David Cameron question that might be asked - is it necessary for the people to Scotland to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with the UK? I have yet to see much by way of grievances listed by Scotland that would justify such a move.  Seems more based on sentimental reasons, and I'm not sure that's justification for separation.  But since I don't live there, and since the UK agreed to abide by the vote, is a moot point.  Scotland will have their say on it, regardless.  Hope they choose wisely.

This will send both Scotland and UK into economic turmoil.
