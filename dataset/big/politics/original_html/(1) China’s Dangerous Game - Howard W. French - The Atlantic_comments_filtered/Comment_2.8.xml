	So your solution is to continue shrugging off terrible acts because others have done them before? Is it not possible that the world as a whole is now trying to set a better standard of behavior? China has had its imperialist moments before too: Xinjiang, Tibet, its foray into Vietnam and decades of propping up North Korea, even clashing with India in the southern Himalayas.
