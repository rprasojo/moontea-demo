	It does leave out Russia, but almost all of the disputes with China are occurring far to the southeast. While Russia does have a new economic agreement with China, I suspect that may a temporary expedient to secure one front while Putin strives to rebuild the old Soviet empire in the west. In the long run, Russia is demographically fading, while China is hungry for more land and resources - all tantalizingly available north of the Amur.
