	There is no "conflict" between China and Tibet. Tibet is a part of China. You may not like that fact but the world doesn't revolve aorund your stupid opinions. You see, there is a thing called international law. There is no country that has denied that Tibet is a part of China. Even the Dalai Lama claims that it is a part of China. But white people like you love to speak on behalf of others.

"Tibet is a part of the People's Republic of China. It is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture."
