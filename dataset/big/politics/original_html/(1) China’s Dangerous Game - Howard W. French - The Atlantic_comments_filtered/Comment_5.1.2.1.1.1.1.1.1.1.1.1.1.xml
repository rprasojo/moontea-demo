	It seems the powers that be (or the little trolls) read our little exchange and thought it better to correct the screwup we discussed. I just saw that your name, and that of the other poster (albertocane) have been restored to the mentioned posts. Wow, we were/are monitored and we have the proof of it, too. I salute (with one finger) their interest in our exchange... Thanks Disqus, or whoever...
