	I wasn't aware that they cited to wikipedia in the big leagues. Two things about UNCLOS. First, the U.S. military (for the most part) establishes its own rules of engagement and has ultimate control over tactical directives. Congress doesn't micromanage military operations--it declares war and provides military funding. Read the U.S. Constitution. Second, the Law of the Sea is NOT simply about maritime resources. It is also about navigation. For some non-wikipedia sources on the subject, see: Raul Pedrozo, Preserving Navigational Rights and Freedoms: The Right to Conduct Military Activities in China’s Exclusive Economic Zone, 9 Chinese J. Int. L. 9 (2010); Eric Donnelly, The United States—China EP-3 Incident: Legality and Realpolitik, 9 J. Conflict & Security L. 25, 28-29 (2004); Johathan G. Odom, The True “Lies” of the Impeccable Incident: What Really Happened, Who Disregarded International Law, and Why Every Nation (Outside of China) Should be Concerned, 18 Mich. St. U. Coll. L. J. Int'l L. 411, 414-15 (2010). The Exclusive Economic Zone covers pretty much the entire Asia-Pacific due to the proximity of island and coastal nations. China's interpretation of the law would prevent ALL foreign navies (not just the U.S.) from conducting operations worldwide to provide disaster relief, counterpiracy, and counterterrorism within 200 miles of any nation's coastline. Again, almost no one agrees with this.
