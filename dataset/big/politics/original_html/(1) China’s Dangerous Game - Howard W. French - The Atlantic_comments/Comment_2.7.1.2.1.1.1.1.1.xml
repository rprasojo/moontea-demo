	I didn't side-step, merely gave a more nuanced answer regarding casus belli instead of the simplistic "Mexicans started it" narrative you're pushing. It's like saying the assassination of Franz Ferdinand started World War I, in that it's not incorrect, just ignores other factors to the degree that it presents a distorted history. Are you just going to ignore the repeated violations of sovereignty that provided Mexico with a laundry list of casus belli and instead focus on the one event that finally provided America with one, even though it was a reaction to American and Texan acts of aggression? Let's do a thought experiment: the US is going through a period of severe political instability, Mexico sends an "exploration" force into Texas, builds a fort and raises the Mexican flag at said fort. They then go on to provide direct assistance to Texan rebels. In your mind, is that not sufficient justification for war? Or would war only be justified when Americans respond to this incursion and kill a few Mexicans in Texas?

The Mexican-American War was an early instance of American imperialism (along with our failed invasion of Canada). Many contemporary accounts felt it represented a betrayal of our republican principles in favor of European-style land grabs by right of conquest; Ulysses Grant went so far as to say the Civil War was divine retribution for this betrayal in his memoirs. In an odd way, he was partially correct, as the annexation of Mexican territories exacerbated tensions between slave and free states.
