	Chinese infrastructure in Africa is great if you need to drive from an oilfield to an oil refinery to an oil port while avoiding any major cities or trade routes. The locals are good enough to dig ditches but the Chinese require imported labor for precise, delicate work like basic construction. They do send a lot of money for housing development and you can see that it's working - the officials who collect it develop much larger houses.

China is about as popular in Africa as the United Fruit Company was in Central America.
