	I agree with your post and appreciate your insight. however, i tend to view the environment as China's major problem. obviously this is connected with the economy of China, but I can't see how the degradation can continue into the future, even if the growth rate slows dramatically. so much damage has already been done.

people will have to deal with the pollution long after the Party is booted out for a sluggish and corrupt economy...
