	You realize that Mexico attacked US forces first, right?



I'm assuming you're referring to the Thornton Affair? That may have provided a sufficient casus belli for Polk (along with Mexico's rejection of John Slidell's offer to forgive $3 million in debt for damages incurred during their war of independence in addition to paying $25-$30 million for Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México), but it's virtually impossible to construe the Americans as anything other than the aggressors.

To do so would ignore America's repeated violations of Mexican sovereignty, such as John C. Frémont's military expedition into California in the winter of 1845-46, which culminated in him building a fort and raising the American flag at said fort. Afterwards, he went on to assist the Bear Flag Revolt. It also ignores American military intervention in the border dispute between Mexico and the Republic of Texas, as Polk sent 3,500 troops under Zachary Taylor in July 1845 to the Nueces River and authorized him to seize the disputed land by force if necessary.
