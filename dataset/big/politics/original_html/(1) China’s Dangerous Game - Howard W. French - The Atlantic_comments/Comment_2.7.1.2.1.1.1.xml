	In those ' violations of Mexican sovereignty ' how many Mexican Soldiers were killed?



It's irrelevant. America sent an armed expedition, built a fort and claimed it as their own on sovereign Mexican soil, then went on to provide direct military support to rebels. Taylor's expeditionary force on the Nueces Strip arrived months prior to Texas's annexation, while it was still being voted on in both Texas and the US. The US was intervening in what was a border dispute between two ostensibly sovereign nations.



Mexico had a tradition of border violations, see the Dawson Massacre, since they never recognized Texas independence or them joining the USA.



Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco without authorization from the Mexican government; he was also under coercion as he was imprisoned, thus the treaties had no legal standing. While Mexico was generally an unstable mess during this time, I don't believe any of the various governments ever ratified them or recognized them as legitimate. Perhaps most importantly, Santa Anna's treaties would not have been considered legitimate under the Mexican constitution, as he did not have the authority to sign such documents.
