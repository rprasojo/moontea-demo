	You do realize that talking about negotiations to resolve a conflict and then describing the conflict as "peaceful" would mean that you are describing Vietnam and the Korean War as "peaceful resolved conflicts" right? Do you not understand how completely absurd that sounds? A war that ends with a negotiated treaty is not something that should be characterized as "peacefully resolved" outside of an Orwell novel.
