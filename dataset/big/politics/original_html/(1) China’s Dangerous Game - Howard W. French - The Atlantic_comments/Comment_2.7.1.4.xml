	"(Haven't you heard of how various parts of the southern United States were violently taken from Mexico? Or how about the Phillipines. I'd suggest you read a few history books about the horrendous, colonialist violence inflicted on the indigenous populations there, on the part of successive generations of American imperialist occupiers.)

The United States has a tragic and disgraceful history of imperialist cruelty all over the world, particularly in Latin America. No amount of revisionist lying on the part of America propagandists is going to erase that history."

And all of this, a good chunk of which happened upwards of 100 years ago, justifies PRC colonialism and jingoism how precisely? At best, the PRC can be politely said to be hypocritical, and it is, to be blunt, practicing gunboat diplomacy and irredentism like they were going out of style. Oh, wait, didn't we fight a war 70 years ago just to end that practice once and for all? the one that China badly wants revenge on Japan for?
