	Hai, Hanah (which one should I use to address you?):

And you ignored the facts that "GodknowsAll" just pointed out: that Vietnam controls most of the small islands in the SCS, and most of these islands lie OUTSIDE of the boundary of its 200-nm EEZ. Vietnam also claims vast portion of SCS (~75%) which is way beyond the 200-nm EEZ line from its shore. Do you have a better story than " the fiction of Chinese historical ownership of SCS dated back to 1,000+ years"??

BTW. Why do you pretend to be somebody else (Hanah Chu) when you are actually Hai Ngyuen??
