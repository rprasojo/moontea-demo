	It would be a moot point, anyway. A "free" Tibet, like a "free" Xinjiang, would be a client state of China. All the significant logstical links and markets are there, and the Han control all the businesses. They might have a freer government, like Mongolia, but that's about it- Mongolia is also pretty much a wholly-owned subsidiary of China, Inc. (or at least a three-quarters owned subsidiary).
