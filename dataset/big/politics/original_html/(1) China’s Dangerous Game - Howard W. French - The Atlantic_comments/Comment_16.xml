	Oh for God's sake. Here (sigh) yet again, we have another jingoistic article by America's chicken-hawk armchair warriors, whining about "how awful it is that China, might want to dominate the South CHINA Sea".

Stop to think about that one, for a second or two. The CHINESE want to "dominate" the CHINA Sea... and America, a country located thousands of miles to the east, literally on the other side of the world, is fulminating with indignation at this "affront".

America -- the country that has, for over 200 years, famously (via the Monroe Doctrine) violently resisted the establishment of ANY non-American great power military relationship in the Western Hemisphere -- is now shrieking outrage at the idea that the Chinese, might actually want to "dominate" a body of water that is right off the coasts of Shanghai... while American nuclear-armed battle fleets cruise up and down that sea, just spoilin' for a fight.

What, pray tell, do you think the American reaction would be, if the Chinese were, for example, sailing ships and submarines, all armed to the teeth with deliverable thermonuclear weapons, up and down the Sea of Cortes, or maybe off the coasts of Big Sur and Long Island?

Tell you what, America -- how about you withdraw your battle fleets from the South CHINA Sea, and the Chinese will promise not to start sailing the same, within spittin' distance of Malibu or Martha's Vineyard.

How about that? Sound like a deal?
