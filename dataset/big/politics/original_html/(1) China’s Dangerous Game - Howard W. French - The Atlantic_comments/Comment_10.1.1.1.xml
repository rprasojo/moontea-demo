	I am not sure what you mean, but my point was simple: the will to confront an aggressor is more important than anything else. I am much more concerned about that, than any new spending on weapons. We can spend all we have if we do not have the will to use those brand new very expensive and oh-so-impressive weapons. Confronting a bully has nothing to do with toys, but everything to do with the will to do it.
