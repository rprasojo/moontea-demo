	I'm not dismissing the pollution as a serious issue, not by any stretch. In fact, I expect that environmental degradation will be the most serious challenge facing China by 2030, far surpassing a graying population and the challenges of creating a domestic market big enough to absorb its productive capacity.

However, the majority of China's people are low enough on Maslow's hierarchy that they literally couldn't care less about long-term environmental degradation. The only places which care to any great extent are the major cities beset by severe air pollution. As such, pollution represents no great threat to the CCP's legitimacy in the eyes of most Chinese, so I completely ignored it above as it doesn't play into their foreign policy at all.
