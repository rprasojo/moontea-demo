	Not really. However it can't be denied that some minority in every country can easily be brainwashed and swing by the propaganda of lies, deceit and disinformation propagated by Western media that democracy is all that matters when behind, the so-called champion of democracy, U.S is in such total mess and shambles. Hong Kong is not much of a difference.
