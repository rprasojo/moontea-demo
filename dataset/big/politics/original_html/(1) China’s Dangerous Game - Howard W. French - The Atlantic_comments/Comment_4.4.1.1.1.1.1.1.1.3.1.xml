	There are already independent countries with a similar cultural background to Tibet and Xin Jiang such as Bhutan and Uzbekistan.

Look I don't give a damn if they become independent but I just think a lot of pro-West commentators use 'free Tibet' as an excuse to screw with countries that aren't soft colonies of the US.

The vast majority of people in China, regardless of area, honestly don't give a damn. But from what I know about these areas like Tibet, that are economically depressed and net tax recipients, is that many residents have good reason to want to remain as part of China economically.

BTW. Only Inner Mongolia is politically part of China, the other parts are more influenced by Russia.
