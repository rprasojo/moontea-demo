	You are correct. I am well aware of the US territorial conquests in the 19th and very early 20th centuries. I've read a number of good books on the subjects. Those events were also a long time ago when international norms were different. Since that age of imperialism, the world catastrophe of the mid 20th century has reshaped the world order to a better place. China is flouting this order now, not 100 years ago. Why does that make it OK for China to behave like the US or Japan behaved 100 years ago, when the history is clear that acting in such a way only leads to destruction and chaos? You cannot condemn the US for its history, and then turn around and use that history to excuse Chinese behavior in the present. THAT is classic propaganda doublethink.
