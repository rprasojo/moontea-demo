	In those ' violations of Mexican sovereignty ' how many Mexican Soldiers were killed?

Mexico had a tradition of border violations, see the Dawson Massacre, since they never recognized Texas independence or them joining the USA.

They didn't follow the Treaties of Velasco, dispite Santa Anna signing them.
