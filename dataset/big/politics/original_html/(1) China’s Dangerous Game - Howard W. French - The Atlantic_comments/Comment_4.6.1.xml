	Internationally ratified zones? Are you sure you know what you are talking about? Are you thinking about International waters which sometimes stretches beyond 200 nautical miles beyond the shore line (not 200 km as you claimed)?

Anyway, as for the Sino-Japanese island, it is not beyond 200 nautical miles of Chinese shores. It less than 200 nautical miles from from mainland Chinese shores and about 140 km from Taiwan and also 140 km from Ishigaki Islands and 410 km from a main Japanese island (Naha)
