	A typical non sequitur from the U.S. propaganda cheerleader chorus. Here, let me reply on your level :

"Why didn't the Americans give up their (nuclear) arsenal, before invading Iraq?"

Oh, and by the way, the Russians never "invaded" either Georgia or Ukraine; instead, what they did was a combination of short border incursions and "dirty tricks" style subversion. If the Russians had "invaded" Georgia or Ukraine, in the way the Americans invaded Iraq, you'd have the Russian Army setting up military checkpoints in Tbilisi and Kiev.
