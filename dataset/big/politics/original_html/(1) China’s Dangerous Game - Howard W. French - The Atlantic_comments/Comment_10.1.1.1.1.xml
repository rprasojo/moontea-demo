	Weapons and their quality and quantity are not toys. They are what determines the outcome. The outcome means, who wins and who loses. The losing side is often gone altogether. Where is the Axis now? Where is Biafra? Where is the last year's snow? When facing very large potential enemies, one needs to think about survival too, among other things.
