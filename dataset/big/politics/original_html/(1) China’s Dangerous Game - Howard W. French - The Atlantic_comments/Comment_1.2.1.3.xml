	"Russia is not rebuilding any Soviet empire. They are responding to the containment via NATO encroaching and US destabilizing via proxy Ukraine."

You don't think this up yourself. You merely retype what your Russian paymasters send you.

I hope you make a good living at it because you certainly appear to be stupid.
