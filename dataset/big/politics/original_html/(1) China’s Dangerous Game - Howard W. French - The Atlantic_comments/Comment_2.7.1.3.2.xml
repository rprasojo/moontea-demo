	George.. Nothing ever changes under the face of the sun.... NO... it is not "different".. you sound like the battered wife that whines "Oh, I'll take him back because it is going to be different this time"...... YES I can "condemn the United States for the history of endless invasions and wars ... the brutalization of other sovereign lands.. the murder of millions (YES hundreds of millions) of innocent people.... I don't think that any other country in history has EVER conducted the incessant wars of attrition that the Un-tied States has.. ....maybe Attila the Hun... But to my knowledge Attila did not go about touting how "generous and christian" he was either.

So before you show your behind by saying I am making all this up, go to Wikipedia and search for "the wars that the United States has been involved in since its initiation"... and SEE what YOU get~!
