	Again, you're deeply confused. Anyone with a three digit IQ can convert nautical miles to km and see that what I said is perfectly consistent. BTW, I referenced all three Japanese AND Chinese and Taiwanese claims in km. I only talked about nautical miles when I was talking about the standard LOS definition which uses nautical miles (which is there usage for general claims). You're confused because you have a double digit IQ.
