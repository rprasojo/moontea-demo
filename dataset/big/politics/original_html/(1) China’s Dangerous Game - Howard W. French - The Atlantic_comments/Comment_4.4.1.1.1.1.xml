	And thank you for voicing for all billion or so Chinese. What you said is technically true. China does not see any territorial dispute with Tibet. According the PRC, Tibet is a wholly owned subsidiary. 60+ years of sometimes violent revolt against that ownership after a very violent invasion by the PRC does seem to indicate that the TIbetans do not consent to the arrangement.
