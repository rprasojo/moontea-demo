	Oh, I see. Then, how do you like being a grad student there? I am guessing you are getting your degree in Chinese (literature, language, history, etc.). You must find it amusing/exasperating to read the rather inaccurate pictures presented of China by both the Western and Chinese posters. Some do it out of ignorance, and some do it out of malice... You could easily tell them apart, couldn't you?

P.S. Your reference to Maslow's hierarchy made me think that you taught there; being a grad student makes sense, too.
