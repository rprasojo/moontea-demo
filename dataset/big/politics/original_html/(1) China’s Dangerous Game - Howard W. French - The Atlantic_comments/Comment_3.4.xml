	"He said it would force China to become more western. Instead, it has created a country with a much better military and a dangerous desire to bully its neighbors."

1) Clinton was wrong because no country can force another to become more "anything".

2) Admitting the PRC into the World Trade Organization did not create a country with a much better military and a dangerous desire to bully its neighbors. If that was the PRC's long term goal, they would have done it anyway.

The USA (my country) is not responsible for every bad thing or good thing that happens in the world. The rest of the world has its own agenda.
