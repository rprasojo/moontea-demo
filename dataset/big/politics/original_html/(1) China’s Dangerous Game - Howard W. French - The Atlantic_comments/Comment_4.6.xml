	Look at the map of claim by the Chinese and see how it extends south through international waters and into the internationally ratified (200km) zones of the affected countries. And in the case of one of the disputed island chains, it was owned by a Japanese national who sold to the Japanese government. Here in Australia we are considering buying cutting edge submarines off the shelf from the Japanese, and the howls of protest from the Chinese have been long and loud. Meanwhile they are setting up bases in Australias' designated zone within Antartica...and they've cruised their warships off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean to intimidate our government when we approved a US Marine training base in the tropical north of our country..they really do have a very unsophisticated bully streak in their behaviour..
