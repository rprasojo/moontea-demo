		There isn't a dispute, because there's no such thing as Tibet, at least as
		far as the nation-state system is concerned. It would be like saying
		"the dispute between the US and the Lakota Nation"; the Lakota may
		argue that they're a conquered people whose land was taken from them,
		but there was never a Lakota nation-state as such that was recognized
		by the world. Tibet? Same.
