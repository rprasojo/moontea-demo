	I'd like to commend you on that post; article worthy. I've read "The Diplomat" et al for some time, which was how I first got in on the IR scene (history graduate here). I came to roughly the same conclusion in my readings, though I had always thought that the military was in collusion with Xi--that is, the whole mechanism substituting ultra-nationalism and irredentism for economic and social progress--rather than the military being divided upon itself.

In that line, however, I have a question: with all the sabre-rattling and irredentism (genuine or a facade) that's been going on, what do you believe are the chances that any of this could spark a military conflict; at what point does it become the preferable option for the CPC in order to satisfy domestic nationalism that they themselves have stirred up?
