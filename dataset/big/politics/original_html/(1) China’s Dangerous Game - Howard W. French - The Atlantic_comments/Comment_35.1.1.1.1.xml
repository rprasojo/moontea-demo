	Interesting isn't it? Remember just a few decades ago the Vietnamese were relying on China to prevent American aggression on their soil. At least today, China, unlike the US is not bombing the H out of them. You know it would be useful if you remembered which nation it was that killed 3 million Vietnamese not that long ago, before you start crticizing China. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones!
