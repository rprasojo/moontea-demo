	Dude, if there's a point to debating with strangers on the internet (a very big if) then it's the chance that you'll convince someone reading your comments that your position is the correct one. Going on and on about how someone is paid by the PRC is doing nothing for your position. Why don't you address his points instead of launching ad hominem attacks? You've made your point that you think he's a paid shill, now engage intellectually or shut up.
