	If those little trolls can get into well-protected bank networks, as they have repeatedly done so recently, I fail to see how Disqus could even present a mediocre challenge to them. But yes, other forums being what they are, the Atlantic's forum is actually not that bad, at all. Even previously decent ones have degenerated into smoke filled biker (leftist and/or rightist) bars where it's not worth one's time and effort to enter, unless one has an inordinate fondness for senseless howling and baying coupled with vicious brawls, without any hope of a reasonable outcome for anyone...
