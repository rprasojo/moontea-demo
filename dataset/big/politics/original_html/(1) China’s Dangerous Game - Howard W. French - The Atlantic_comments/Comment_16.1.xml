	Let's actually come up with a useful analogy here, if we're going to use analogies.

Let us say that the United States is a rising power, expanding economically for the first time in about two centuries after being kicked around as a colonial battlefield by everyone with a navy for a long period of time. We HATE... let's say Colombia... because they invaded us a 70 years ago and we're good at holding a grudge. Futhermore, we regard Mexico, Canada, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and EVERYTHING ELSE around us as little more than wayward vassal states who'd best get the h*ll back in line, or else. We have irredentist claims on territory with almost every nation we border, and we throw our weight around, frankly bullying the hell out of anyone we think can't stand up to us. Furthermore, we have a domestic historical and media narrative that reads like a German propaganda piece in 1935, and an utterly opaque and somewhat unstable government that views foreign policy as a tool in maintaining domestic power. Do you think the global powers that be in this situation wouldn't regard us as a legitimate threat to peace in our corner of the world?
