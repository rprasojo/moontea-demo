	There was a Tibetan state before they joined the Mongolian and later Manchurian metastates. It was recognized by many countries in Asia. There are also people of Tibetan heritage living in various parts of China.

But a lot of areas that have a problem with the Chinese government have problems with what they perceive as big-government policies, such as traditional Chinese laicization vs. their attitude regarding church and state.

BTW. Check out this series on the history of socialism in Tibet. Actually many people supported the revolution originally. http://kasamaproject.org/histo...
