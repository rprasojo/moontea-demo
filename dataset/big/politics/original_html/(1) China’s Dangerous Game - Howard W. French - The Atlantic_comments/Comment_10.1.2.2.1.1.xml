	Actually, the Chinese had quite a few of those, too, and not a few of them lead armies, or naval squadrons, very successfully. It was the court eunuchs who ran China pretty much up until the turn of the 20th century - or the last Emperor - when the practice was discontinued. Eunuchs in the employ of the Sultans were mostly employed as harem guards, while in China they wielded actual, real power; administrative as well as military.
