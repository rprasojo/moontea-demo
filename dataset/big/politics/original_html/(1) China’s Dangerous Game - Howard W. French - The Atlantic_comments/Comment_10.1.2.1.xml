	1. No, testicles are not sine qua non for killing a lot of people. There are many examples in history where a lot of killing was done by, or ordered by folks without a 'Y' chromosome; or even with a 'Y' chromosome but no testicles... 2. I used "testicles", the word, as a metaphor for resolute determination to do whatever is necessary, even if it involves killing a lot of people. Whether you like my metaphor or not, is your business, not mine; but thanks for sharing. 3. Don't flatter yourself that, expressing what you like or you don't like, regarding my beliefs, will make me want to express myself in a way that would meet your approval, and/or liking. But, again, if you feel the need to share, that is your prerogative, and I don't really mind.
