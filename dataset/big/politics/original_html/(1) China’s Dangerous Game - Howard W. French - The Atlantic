They are responding to the containment via NATO encroaching and US destabilizing via proxy Ukraine. Crimea is merely a return of what was always Russian, and Ukraine disintegration is natural due to corruption and its proxy status against Russia. You reap what you sow, and the Hegemon is reaping reaction to its attempts to destroy the Russian Federation.\n\n\nChina may be hungry for resources, but it's maritime reach is based on historical realities. The U.S. is desperate to maintain its naval hegemony, and China is nullifying that with its carrier-killer missile threat. A new Maritime Silk Road and a proposed canal through Thailand would eliminate the Straits of Malacca as a choke point the U.S. controls. Who is trying to limit who where? Its the US trying to stop China from being a true blue water naval power. The U.S. using an imperialistic Japan to torment China, Taiwan and South Korea in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. \n\n\nThe 20th Century realities are gone. China and Russia will build a Eurasian market of over 3.5 billion people from the Far East and South Asia (India) to Russia and East Europe through Central Asia. This coming realty is what reduces the West and its corrupt EU, maniacal Nato, and collapsing American governmental tyranny to secondary position if they don't change from Hegemon to a multi-polar player.\n\n\nDig into the facts of the SCO, the New Silk Road, the Maritime Silk Road and look at the militarism of Abe's Japan and the use of the Philippines as proxy for the US. \n\n\nChina merely is the new bank for all emerging and most developing nations. A role once filled by a financially sound U.S. Now, the U.S. can only spread chaos and attempt de-stabilization to hold onto power. It's run as an empire is coming to an end. It may take ten more years, but debt will be the victor over the tyrant. The Liberals inherited the world and have destroyed it with their ideologies and wars.\n\n\nRussia and China signed strategic economic and technological agreements far beyond the big gas deal. Now they are working on space, jumbo airliner, weapons, agriculture, rail, home construction, ports, bridges, pipelines, education, IT security, oil and gas and fresh water projects, food, currency, banking and finance (substitute for SWIFT and use of the Chinese credit card system). The Far East and Siberia, and Crimea and East Ukraine (now Novorossiya) are all areas of integration of Chinese and Russian development, as well as Northeast China (Heliongjiang Province) opening up to Russia projects. \n\n\nEven India is getting Chinese investment for its infrastructure projects. If India wasn't so corrupt, they would have many more Chinese built ports and highways. The Chinese are going to modernize the India rail system.\n\n\nThe U.S. maybe thinks it can send Tweets and try to start some more color revolutions, but it has very little to offer to any but the most subservient nations.

<p>This article is comprehensive, but lacks one major component—Russia. Russia has skin in the game of Asia. It has its disputed regions with Japan, it has a stake in controlling the DPRK and the nuclear threat from North Korea. It has a new very strategic economic relationship with China.</p><p>How do you write a major review of the last several years of the state of the East China and South China Sea disputes and leave Russia out?</p>

<p>It does leave out Russia, but almost all of the disputes with China  are occurring far to the southeast. While Russia does have a new economic agreement with China, I suspect that may a temporary expedient to secure one front while Putin strives to rebuild the old Soviet empire in the west. In the long run, Russia is demographically fading, while China is hungry for more land and resources - all tantalizingly available north of the Amur.</p>

<p>Disagree with several of your comments. <br>Russia is not rebuilding any Soviet empire. They are responding to the containment via NATO encroaching and US destabilizing via proxy Ukraine. Crimea is merely a return of what was always Russian, and Ukraine disintegration is natural due to corruption and its proxy status against Russia. You reap what you sow, and the Hegemon is reaping reaction to its attempts to destroy the Russian Federation.</p><p>China may be hungry for resources, but it's maritime reach is based on historical realities. The U.S. is desperate to maintain its naval hegemony, and China is nullifying that with its carrier-killer missile threat. A new Maritime Silk Road and a proposed canal through Thailand would eliminate the Straits of Malacca as a choke point the U.S. controls. Who is trying to limit who where? Its the US trying to stop China from being a true blue water naval power. The U.S. using an imperialistic Japan to torment China, Taiwan and South Korea in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.</p><p>The 20th Century realities are gone. China and Russia will build a Eurasian market of over 3.5 billion people from the Far East and South Asia (India) to Russia and East Europe through Central Asia. This coming realty is what reduces the West and its corrupt EU, maniacal Nato, and collapsing American governmental tyranny to secondary position if they don't change from Hegemon to a multi-polar player.</p><p>Dig into the facts of the SCO, the New Silk Road, the Maritime Silk Road and look at the militarism of Abe's Japan and the use of the Philippines as proxy for the US.</p><p>China merely is the new bank for all emerging and most developing nations. A role once filled by a financially sound U.S. Now, the U.S. can only spread chaos and attempt de-stabilization to hold onto power. It's run as an empire is coming to an end. It may take ten more years, but debt will be the victor over the tyrant. The Liberals inherited the world and have destroyed it with their ideologies and wars.</p><p>Russia and China signed strategic economic and technological agreements far beyond the big gas deal. Now they are working on space, jumbo airliner, weapons, agriculture, rail, home construction, ports, bridges, pipelines, education, IT security, oil and gas and fresh water projects, food, currency, banking and finance (substitute for SWIFT and use of the Chinese credit card system). The Far East and Siberia, and Crimea and East Ukraine (now Novorossiya) are all areas of integration of Chinese and Russian development, as well as Northeast China (Heliongjiang Province) opening up to Russia projects.</p><p>Even India is getting Chinese investment for its infrastructure projects. If India wasn't so corrupt, they would have many more Chinese built ports and highways. The Chinese are going to modernize the India rail system.</p><p>The U.S. maybe thinks it can send Tweets and try to start some more color revolutions, but it has very little to offer to any but the most subservient nations. It is bringing down all its allies with debt and draconian Trade agreements. Look into TTIP and TTP and see how it colonizes any nation that joins. Pure hegemony in exchange for a nuclear umbrella and debt.</p>

<p>Yawn...</p><p>Oh I wish prose and thought when together but your writing belies too much anti-US bias to be taken as anything more than ranting.  But from your screed it is clear that you really don't care about 'people' or 'rights' (China and Russia!)  The Pax-China is about to end and Putin's bare chest and regressive policies are a bit hard to idolize.</p><p>But thanks for the rant - it made me laugh.</p>

<p>I did get a laugh at the dig at India's (96/177 in the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index) level of corruption, when corruption is just as endemic in both China (80/177) and especially Russia (127/177).</p><p>(By comparison, the United States' ranking is 19/177.)</p><p>And much of the economic growth in China has been fueled by the "shadow banking" system, which is functionally the equivalent of a house of cards built on quicksand.<br>There are other signifiicant challenges to the vision of economic integration outlined above, but I can't be bothered to write a W.O.T. at the moment.</p>

<p>Matthew,</p><p>For those who believe democracy cures all, China vs India is antithesis. Also in 1979, China's GDP and India GDP were the same despite India's smaller population. Now China is almost 5 times bigger than India's (nominal GDP). No Han Chinese dissidents live in the "largest democracy." </p>

<p>While i agree that democracy does not cures all, it prevents from getting worse. Since you are using India-China comparison, in the 60s when both India and China had more or less similar per capita incomes, India did not experience mass tragedies like 'Great leap forward' and the resultant famines and deaths which China experienced.</p>

<p>And you forgot to mention facts that all Chinese possessions in the South China Sea were resulted from recent invasions (Paracel/1974, 8 Spratly/ 1988, Mischief/1995 and Scarborough/2013) or China never controlled anything. So much for the fiction of Chinese historical ownership of SCS dated back to 1,000+ years.</p>

<p>Hai, Hanah (which one should I use to address you?):</p><p>And you ignored the facts that "GodknowsAll" just pointed out: that Vietnam controls most of the small islands in the SCS, and most of these islands lie OUTSIDE of the boundary of its 200-nm EEZ. Vietnam also claims vast portion of SCS (~75%) which is way beyond the 200-nm EEZ line from its shore. Do you have a better story than " the fiction of Chinese historical ownership of SCS dated back to 1,000+ years"??</p><p>BTW. Why do you pretend to be somebody else (Hanah Chu) when you are actually Hai Ngyuen??</p>

<p>Thanks for the stupid "straw man" attack.</p><p>Nobody here suggested that China is a democracy. What I and others have been saying is, American nationalists and jingoists are whining about China engaging in a very mild version of the gunboat diplomacy that has been engaged in by the United States, for over a century now. It was just fine and dandy when it was done by English-speaking white people, but oh, my goodness! We can't let those yellow Chinese play "our" little imperialist game.</p><p>Well, sorry, squire... nonsense propaganda of this type may play very well in Topeka, but it doesn't play very well at all in, say, Shanghai... not to mention Jakarta.</p>

<p>I doubt it. Take the US out of the picture and you get a nuclear Japan (and probably Australia and possibly Indonesia) and much more developed multi-lateral defense cooperation. Right now these nations all use bilateral relationships between themselves and the US and rely on the US to coordinate because they have historical hatreds that make direct cooperation politically unpalatable.</p><p>However, the threat of hanging (if the US were to give up and withdraw from the region) would concentrate their minds wonderfully, I suspect, to the point where little niceties like "historical dislike" would go out the window in the scramble to assemble enough Lilliputians to tie down the large man lurking in the corner.</p>

<p>International norms have changed since the 19th century.  The 19th and 20th Century imperial powers (which included an enthusiastic Japan) caused such chaos and suffering that they themselves created a newer, better order.  China doesn't need to prove, again, that aggressive colony building and military adventurism are destructive.  We have enough of a reminder of that from the US as it is (but the US doesn't attempt territorial expansion, for whatever that's worth).</p>

I'd suggest you read a few history books about the horrendous, colonialist violence inflicted on the indigenous populations there, on the part of successive generations of American imperialist occupiers.)</p><p>The United States has a tragic and disgraceful history of imperialist cruelty all over the world, particularly in Latin America. No amount of revisionist lying on the part of America propagandists is going to erase that history.</p>

<blockquote>You realize that Mexico attacked US forces first, right?</blockquote><p></p><p>I'm assuming you're referring to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton_Affair" rel="nofollow">Thornton Affair</a>? That may have provided a sufficient casus belli for Polk (along with Mexico's rejection of John Slidell's offer to forgive $3 million in debt for damages incurred during their war of independence in addition to paying $25-$30 million for Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México), but it's virtually impossible to construe the Americans as anything other than the aggressors.</p><p>To do so would ignore America's repeated violations of Mexican sovereignty, such as John C. Frémont's military expedition into California in the winter of 1845-46, which culminated in him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Peak_%28California%29" rel="nofollow">building a fort</a> and raising the American flag at said fort. Afterwards, he went on to assist the Bear Flag Revolt. It also ignores American military intervention in the border dispute between Mexico and the Republic of Texas, as Polk sent 3,500 troops under Zachary Taylor in July 1845 to the Nueces River and authorized him to seize the disputed land by force if necessary.</p>

<blockquote>In those ' violations of Mexican sovereignty ' how many Mexican Soldiers were killed?</blockquote><p></p><p>It's irrelevant. America sent an armed expedition, built a fort and claimed it as their own on sovereign Mexican soil, then went on to provide direct military support to rebels. Taylor's expeditionary force on the Nueces Strip arrived months prior to Texas's annexation, while it was still being voted on in both Texas and the US. The US was intervening in what was a border dispute between two ostensibly sovereign nations.</p><p></p><blockquote>Mexico had a tradition of border violations, see the Dawson Massacre, since they never recognized Texas independence or them joining the USA.</blockquote><p></p><p>Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco without authorization from the Mexican government; he was also under coercion as he was imprisoned, thus the treaties had no legal standing. While Mexico was generally an unstable mess during this time, I don't believe any of the various governments ever ratified them or recognized them as legitimate. Perhaps most importantly, Santa Anna's treaties would not have been considered legitimate under the Mexican constitution, as he did not have the authority to sign such documents.</p>

<p>I didn't side-step, merely gave a more nuanced answer regarding casus belli instead of the simplistic "Mexicans started it" narrative you're pushing. It's like saying the assassination of Franz Ferdinand started World War I, in that it's not incorrect, just ignores other factors to the degree that it presents a distorted history. Are you just going to ignore the repeated violations of sovereignty that provided Mexico with a laundry list of casus belli and instead focus on the one event that finally provided America with one, even though it was a reaction to American and Texan acts of aggression? Let's do a thought experiment: the US is going through a period of severe political instability, Mexico sends an "exploration" force into Texas, builds a fort and raises the Mexican flag at said fort. They then go on to provide direct assistance to Texan rebels. In your mind, is that not sufficient justification for war? Or would war only be justified when Americans respond to this incursion and kill a few Mexicans in Texas?</p><p>The Mexican-American War was an early instance of American imperialism (along with our failed invasion of Canada). Many contemporary accounts felt it represented a betrayal of our republican principles in favor of European-style land grabs by right of conquest; Ulysses Grant went so far as to say the Civil War was divine retribution for this betrayal in his memoirs. In an odd way, he was partially correct, as the annexation of Mexican territories exacerbated tensions between slave and free states.</p>

<p>As some other commenters have correctly pointed out, America was (as usual) the aggressor in every one of these conflicts, although to be fair about it these are mostly in the past (unless you count America's disgraceful record, up to the current day, in Latin America).</p><p>I resent charges of "whataboutism". In no way, shape or form am I defending all of China's actions (although I DO defend some of them) -- what I'm doing is simply pointing out the rank hypocrisy of the world's #1 imperialist, militarist aggressor nation -- specifically the United States -- sitting there whining about "nasty, 'aggressive' old China", for the "outrage" of trying to dominate the South CHINA Sea. To be able to spew propaganda like this with a straight face is a uniquely American attribute, given that your own country has a much, MUCH worse track record of illegally interfering in the domestic affairs of countries literally around the world -- whereas China's similar "offenses", if any, lie only in the future.</p><p>Oh, and I suppose, anybody who calls out American nonsense propaganda and hypocrisy, must be a "paid stooge" of those who you hate (in this case, I assume that's China)... do I have that right? Well go stuff yourself. I work for nobody but myself, as if that needed to be said.</p><p>So who do YOU work for, my jingoistic American friend? C_A, N_A, F_I or just the Tupelo, Mississippi, Dog Catcher's Department?</p>

<p>You are correct.  I am well aware of the US territorial conquests in the 19th and very early 20th centuries.  I've read a number of good books on the subjects.  Those events were also a long time ago when international norms were different.  Since that age of imperialism, the world catastrophe of the mid 20th century has reshaped the world order to a better place.  China is flouting this order now, not 100 years ago.  Why does that make it OK for China to behave like the US or Japan behaved 100 years ago, when the history is clear that acting in such a way only leads to destruction and chaos?   You cannot condemn the US for its history, and then turn around and use that history to excuse Chinese behavior in the present.  THAT is classic propaganda doublethink.</p>

<p>George.. Nothing ever changes under the face of the sun....<br>NO... it is not "different".. you sound like the battered wife that whines "Oh, I'll take him back because it is going to be different this time"......<br>YES I can "condemn the United States for the history of endless invasions and wars ... the brutalization of other sovereign lands.. the murder of millions (YES hundreds of millions) of innocent people....  I don't think that any other country in history has EVER conducted the incessant wars of attrition that the Un-tied States has.. <br>  ....maybe Attila the Hun... <br>But to my knowledge Attila did not go about touting how "generous and christian" he was either.</p><p>So before you show your behind by saying I am making all this up, go to Wikipedia and search for "the wars that the United States has been involved in since its initiation"... and SEE what YOU get~!</p>

<p>Ironically, the USSR and China (both the Republic of, and the People's Republic of) have been, combined or individually, responsible for far more deaths than the U.S has in all of its wars; during the purges, upwards of 20 million disappeared in Russia, and a further 30 million died as a result of World War II. The "Great Leap Forward" in China, as well as the "Cultural Revolution" were, directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of another 30 million, largely due to famine caused by poor economic policy.</p><p>That these crimes were committed against the people of one's own nation rather than the peoples of other nations makes them no less significant.</p><p>Further, as far as aggression goes, you may also want to check out the wars that Russia and China have been involved in. Finland, Georgia, Ukraine, Poland (Russia), and Tibet, Vietnam, Korea and India (China) figure prominently.</p><p>Thus, while the U.S is certainly the most prolific offender, it is hardly the only one. Your myopia regarding the U.S reveals a single-minded, almost conspiratorial bias, which I have seen many a time before.</p><p>Put more simply: you are a conspiracy theorist, and thus intellectually lazy; your painting of the U.S as "black" against the "white" of supposedly victimized nations not only hypocritically strips away the very real political and international agency of all nations, but also serves as a proxy by which you can paint yourself as a victim of this system that, supposedly, has the power to bend entire nations to the "Machiavellian" designs of the U.S. In turn, since you are a "victim" of this "system," you can thus excuse any inaction on your part, and put all blame and responsibility regarding your socioeconomic standing on the shoulders of some entity that does not physically exist. Pathetic, really.</p>

<p>Really? Please find me ONE (1) parallel, undertaken by either Russia or China since World War 2, in which either of those countries engaged in something like the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq.</p><p>Oh, and of course, to satisfy this request, you'll have to find a situation in which (for example) either Russia or China sailed a battle fleet, literally around the world, and -- in the face of nearly unanimous international condemnation -- launched a full-scale military invasion and years-long occupation of a country oceans away from them. (I know you're going to bring up Tibet and Afghanistan, and while I deplored both of these situations, I'd note that both of them were right on the borders of the superpowers involved, and that at least in Russia's case this was undertaken by a regime that is no longer there -- in sharp contrast to the United States, in which the same oligopoly has been in charge literally since the Industrial Revolution.)</p><p>While you're at it... can you find me where Russia or China have engaged in a world-wide program of kidnap and torture, such as "extraordinary rendition"? Make sure to show me all the helpless Third World peasants who Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping have murdered with remote-controlled drone strikes.</p><p>Or maybe you're just a "proxy" for American state propaganda, yourself. How... pathetic.</p>

<p>"Really? Please find me ONE (1) parallel, undertaken by either Russia or <br>China since World War 2, in which either of those countries engaged in <br>something like the illegal U.S. invasion of Iraq."</p><p>They don't have to, and your asking me to find that sort of example is in and of itself an attempt to discredit by asking for an impossible standard of evidence. And I don't need Tibet or Afghanistan, though those would suffice.</p><p>Rather, I can point you, most recently, to Ukraine on the part of Russia (irredentist revanchism on the part of Putin) and to the multiple attempts on the part of the PRC to extend its economic and military control over a swath of ocean and territory which neither it nor the dynasties it bases its claims off of ever had administration or actual legal control. In both cases, the fundamental logic is the same as the U.S invasion of Iraq; the use of military invasion or coercion based on at best shaky logic or outright revanchism in order to distract from domestic crises or to generate political capital.</p><p>"-- in sharp contrast to the United States, in which the same oligopoly <br>has been in charge literally since the Industrial Revolution.)"</p><p>As opposed to oligopolies that were, are, and will be in power in both the Russian Federation and the PRC for the forseeable future? Don't make me laugh. You are basically accusing the U.S of having barely advanced forward from the times when companies owned entire towns and deliberately kept workers in debt; much progress has been made since then, in no small part thanks to the (now dwindling) strength of unions in the U.S.</p><p>I won't call the U.S perfect--far from it, in fact; but there are no circumstances that will let me think that the PRC or Russia are somehow better or more worthy of praise merely because they victimize their own populations and neighbors' populations rather than going half-way around the world to do so. Further, at no time were the lies surrounding the Iraq War--which were swiftly revealed by an independent western press both within and without the U.S--ever as pervasive as the deliberate propaganda and outright lies surrounding Russia's campaign in Ukraine.</p>

<p>"...Since that age of imperialism, the world catastrophe of the mid 20th century has reshaped the world order to a better place.  China is flouting this order now, not 100 years ago..."</p><p>See, here's the problem. Evidently, what you imagine as the "world order" is a world in which America :</p><p>-- Illegally invades, devastates and occupies countries like Iraq;</p><p>-- Subverts the Internet's basic infrastructure in order to engage in mass surveillance on (literally) everyone in the entire world;</p><p>-- Maintains an enormous arsenal of deliverable thermonuclear weapons, occasionally threatening their first use against enemies real or imagined, who don't have any;</p><p>-- Maintains a world-wide Gulag of illegal political prisons such as Guantanamo;</p><p>-- Engages in random murder (via drone strikes, assassination raids etc.) of people who the President of the United States, on his secret, unilateral order, has marked for immediate death, without benefit of a trial;</p><p>-- Sails nuclear-armed battle fleets, just outside (and sometimes inside) the territorial waters of unfriendly nations (including China and Iran), spoiling for a fight and "daring" the country involved to take the first shot;</p><p>-- Repeatedly attempts and / or supports the violent, illegal overthrow of foreign governments, including (for example, in Venezuela, Egypt and the Gaza Strip) democratically-elected governments...</p><p>I could go on and on.</p><p>The point here is, anything that China (or Russia) has done -- certainly since the Maoist period -- pales by comparison with the United States' own, extensive list of gross violations of international law, aggression against other countries and dangerous, provocative military posturing (how about, for example, repeated violations of Chinese airspace by U.S. spy planes -- what do you suppose America would do, if Chinese aircraft routinely overflew, say, Camp Pendleton, without notice or authorization?).</p><p>So DON'T lecture ME, about "the 'world order', and how naughty old China, is 'violating' it". You are using a nonsense, laughably ethno-centric construct of unilateralist, jingoist American propaganda, to create a sham complaint against something that China has dabbled in, while the United States has sprayed all over the place. It may play well in "God's Chosen Country", but out here in the rest of the world, after we finish laughing ourselves silly upon hearing it... we get angry.</p>

<p>A typical non sequitur from the U.S. propaganda cheerleader chorus. Here, let me reply on your level :</p><p>"Why didn't the Americans give up their (nuclear) arsenal, before invading Iraq?"</p><p>Oh, and by the way, the Russians never "invaded" either Georgia or Ukraine; instead, what they did was a combination of short border incursions and "dirty tricks" style subversion. If the Russians had "invaded" Georgia or Ukraine, in the way the Americans invaded Iraq, you'd have the Russian Army setting up military checkpoints in Tbilisi and Kiev.</p>

<p>"(Haven't you heard of how various parts of the southern United States<br> were violently taken from Mexico? Or how about the Phillipines.

No amount of <br>revisionist lying on the part of America propagandists is going to erase<br> that history."</p><p>And all of this, a good chunk of which happened upwards of 100 years ago, justifies PRC colonialism and jingoism how precisely?

<p>It's called the Law of the Sea Convention, and pretty much every country on earth subscribes to the same interpretation of the law--except for China.  They want complete military dominion over the Exclusive Economic Zone (200 nautical miles from shore), which is something no one else agrees with.  So please, don't speak for "Asians."</p>

<p>Would that be the Law of the Sea Convention, that the United States -- uniquely among all the world's developed nations (because of fanatical, conspiracy-theory reactionary dogma on the part of the Republican Party) -- obstinately refuses to sign, implement or respect?</p><p>So please, don't speak for "the law of the sea". Almost everyone, China included, can be or does respect or implement it. ONLY AMERICA sits there thumbing its nose at this (along with scores of other) articles of international law. China will have to go a long way before it gets anywhere near America's fundamental contempt towards the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Yes, that same Law of the Sea Convention.  The one that the U.S. Navy still adheres to in spite of Congress's unwillingness to ratify.  And let's not forget America's adherence to the San Remo Manual and the Hague Convention of 1907, the latter of which China violates to a dangerous degree with its development of offensive sea mines.  Say what you will about American ground operations, but in terms of our naval policy, we do more to uphold international norms than any other nation.  China is so far outside of the international consensus it's not even funny.</p>

<p>"... that same Law of the Sea Convention.  The one that the U.S. Navy still adheres to in spite of Congress's unwillingness to ratify..."</p><p>That's not true (for two obvious reasons : one, the U.S. Navy, by American law and the chain of command, MUST implement the policies of the U.S. government, and two, the Law of the Sea treaty is mostly about management of maritime resources, not the activities of military vessels on the high seas).</p><p>For further reference, see :</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p><p>Did you REALLY think you could get away with such pathetically lame, transparently self-serving American propaganda? Sorry, squire; you're arguing in the big leagues, now, and the kind of flag-wavin' drivel that the natives lap up like Pavlov's dogs back in Topeka and Baton Rouge, doesn't cut it with non-American audiences.</p><p>Now as to China's supposed "illegal" development of offensive sea mines. I'd remind you that the one country that has done more to thumb its nose at all international conventions -- including but by no means limited to the various Hague conventions (and, significantly, the non-proliferation treaties... remember them?) -- than ANYONE else, is your nice beloved United States; so you're in a very exposed position indeed, in fatuously trying to point fingers at the Chinese (or anyone) for what they may or may not have done in trying to catch up to America's globe-encircling, nuclear-armed imperialist naval fleets.</p><p>But let's take "offensive sea mines", since you seem to be so hung up on them. Were you unaware of the following, sir?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_60_CAPTOR" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p><p>Maybe you had better &lt;ahem&gt; do a bit more research before you start pompously pontificating about "those nasty Chinese sea mines".</p><p>Oh, but I FORGOT; American offensive sea mines are "good", while those used by anyone else, are "bad", because, of course, within the crazy-house "reasoning" of your nation's jingoistic, self-serving propaganda, America is an "exceptional" nation that gets to do things which would, if done by anyone else, be cause for sanctions, trials, bombing raids, and even "pre-emptive wars".</p><p>So... what's "not even funny"?</p><p>I'll tell you : Having to listen to propaganda from someone who doesn't understand that he's repeating it.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware that they cited to wikipedia in the big leagues.  Two things about UNCLOS.  First, the U.S. military (for the most part) establishes its own rules of engagement and has ultimate control over tactical directives.  Congress doesn't micromanage military operations--it declares war and provides military funding.  Read the U.S. Constitution.  Second, the Law of the Sea is NOT simply about maritime resources.  It is also about navigation.  For some non-wikipedia sources on the subject, see: Raul Pedrozo, Preserving Navigational Rights and Freedoms: The Right to Conduct Military Activities in China’s Exclusive Economic Zone, 9 Chinese J. Int. L. 9 (2010); Eric Donnelly, The United States—China EP-3 Incident: Legality and Realpolitik, 9 J. Conflict &amp; Security L. 25, 28-29 (2004); Johathan G. Odom, The True “Lies” of the Impeccable Incident: What Really Happened, Who Disregarded International Law, and Why Every Nation (Outside of China) Should be Concerned, 18 Mich. St. U. Coll. L. J. Int'l L. 411, 414-15 (2010).  The Exclusive Economic Zone covers pretty much the entire Asia-Pacific due to the proximity of island and coastal nations.  China's interpretation of the law would prevent ALL foreign navies (not just the U.S.) from conducting operations worldwide to provide disaster relief, counterpiracy, and counterterrorism within 200 miles of any nation's coastline.  Again, almost no one agrees with this.</p>

<p>What you have there, squire, is a long list of bafflegab excuses, self-referential pseudo-legal pleadings, jingoistic periodical articles by creatures of the U.S. military-industrial complex (John Odom, for example, is a former U.S. Army officer... what do you think people would say, if I started to quote opinion pieces by former officers of the People's Liberation Army?) and red herrings (similar to the tactics endlessly used by pro-settler propagandists, in trying to "prove" that the West Bank "always 'belonged' to Jews, even though it was 'temporarily' occupied by Palestinians for hundreds of years") to distract viewers from the basic fact that the United States -- virtually alone among major nations -- has obstinately refused to sign, ratify or implement the Law of the Sea treaty.</p><p>You want to talk about anything and everything EXCEPT this undeniable fact, which, unfortunately for you, invalidates your entire argument -- because you can't sit there bawling about "those nasty Chinese and how they're 'misinterpreting' a treaty that they SIGNED" -- when your own beloved country didn't even SIGN the damn thing in the first place, and makes a point of its having refused to do so. This is equivalent to, "you get in a car accident with an uninsured driver, and then he shrieks at you for not picking a low enough deductible for your insurance policy".</p><p>What Americans like you think they are accomplishing with this kind of ridiculously (and transparently) self-serving, rankly hypocritical propaganda, honestly escapes me. Whatever one can say about the Chinese (and for the record I am not a fan of their corrupt dictatorship), they at least have the modesty not to harangue other nations for not complying with treaties that they, themselves, thumbed their noses at.</p>

<p>Also, you didn't read the Hague Convention on sea mines, did you?  Apologies about my previous post--I simply referred to "offensive sea mines" instead of clarifying.  They are developing an arsenal of "drifting mines" that simply float in the water and don't detonate.  That's disastrous for international commerce and pretty much every neutral vessel passing through the region. The Convention specifically prohibits "unanchored contact mines" that do not "become harmless [after] one hour at most."  Hague Convention of 1907 No. VIII Relative to the Laying of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines, art. I, Oct. 18, 1907; Jason Reddish, Forgotten Fears Present Imminent Threats to the Maritime Shipping and Recreation Industries: The Risk Posed by the Availability of Sea Mines, 29 Tul. Mar. L.J. 125, 129 (2004); Andrew S. Erickson, Lyle J. Goldstein, &amp; William S. Murray, Chinese Mine Warefare: A PLA Navy “Assassin’s Mace” Capability, Naval War College China Maritime Studies No. 3, at 1 (2009); A.G.Y. Thorpe, Mine Warfare at Sea--Some Legal Aspects of the Future, 18 Ocean Dev. &amp; Int. L. 255, 263<br>(1987). China ratified the Convention's provisions on sea mines over a century ago because it suffered from the effects of the Russo-Japanese War, which it wasn't even part of.  Howard S. Levie, Mine Warfare at Sea 28-29 (1992) (“[A] very considerable number of [Chinese] coasting trade boats, fishing boats, junks and sampans have sunk as a consequence of collisions with these automatic submarine contact mines . . . . It is calculated that from five to six hundred of [China’s] countrymen in the pursuit of their peaceful occupations have met a cruel death through these dangerous engines.”).  It looks like they forgot about that experience.  Anyway, I'm done with this thread.  I apologize for not doing more "research."</p>

Hong Kong is not much of a difference.</p>

<p>"He said it would force China to become more western. Instead, it has created a country with a much better military and a dangerous desire to bully its neighbors."</p><p>1) Clinton was wrong because no country can force another to become more "anything".</p><p>2) Admitting the PRC into the World Trade Organization did not create a country with a much better military and a dangerous desire to bully its neighbors. If that was the PRC's long term goal, they would have done it anyway.</p><p>The USA (my country) is not responsible for every bad thing or good thing that happens in the world.

<p>Of course, there's one crucial difference between the Soviet Union's millitary buildup and China's- Deng pegged the military buildup to GDP, insisting that the  military's share could never rise about 4% on his watch (unlike the Soviet Union, whose military took roughly 25-35% at it's peak).</p><p>It never has, but back when 4% meant 4% of squat, it wasn't much of a threat. Now that it's 4% of the world's second largest economy... that's a whole different ballgame.</p><p>Smart. Very, very smart.</p>

<p>This is highly inaccurate and biased. Unlike Russia, China has for a very long time claimed much of these areas. Russia voluntarily gave up Crimea in the 70s but has unilaterally reclaimed it. These areas that China and its neighbors claim are considered disputed territory within international law unlike Crimea which has been Ukrainian autonomous region for more than 40 years.</p><p>Second, some historical context. China has more land borders with other countries than any country in the world and because of that fact one of the most territorial disputes historically. It has resolved almost all of them (except with India) peacefully through negotiation. That is unprecedented as most territorial disputes are resolved militarily.</p><p>China's so called aggression in the S. China seas today is actually a tit for tat strategy when their negotiation offers have been rebuffed and they have come under aggressive behavior from its neighbors (such as when Japan allowed the government to buy a disputed island or Vietnam's aggressive naval actions). Remember, Japan didn't even consider the Islands China also claims to be disputed territory until last year. There was and probably still is no hope of negotiation.</p><p>Third, according to a study by the political scientist Joshua Goldstein, China is the most peaceful of all major military powers in the last 40 years.</p><p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/think_again_war" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/a...</a></p><p>So the odds of war, though bigger than most people imagine in these territorial disputes, may not necessarily be due to Chinese aggression as this and almost all other articles in the western press suggest.</p>

<p>You do realize that talking about negotiations to resolve a conflict and then describing the conflict as "peaceful" would mean that you are describing Vietnam and the Korean War as "peaceful resolved conflicts" right? Do you not understand how completely absurd that sounds? A war that ends with a negotiated treaty is not something that should be characterized as "peacefully resolved" outside of an Orwell novel.</p>

<p>I never said the conflicts were peaceful. Do you need remedial reading lessons?  I said that they were resolved through peaceful negotiations (true). That doesn't mean nor imply that there weren't at some point some conflicts with some countries. BTW, the Korean war was not a territorial conflict between China and another country. </p>

<p>The majority of inter-state conflicts are resolved through negotiations and treaties. The statement is meaningless and misleading and mischaracterizes the substantive nature of the conflict itself by focusing on a pointless digression. How many negotiations *aren't* peaceful? I can't help but think that this is intentional obfuscation on your part.</p>

That's awesome that you can use a dictionary but using it and understanding it in the context of the present debate are two different things.</p>

<p>Dude, if there's a point to debating with strangers on the internet (a very big if) then it's the chance that you'll convince someone reading your comments that your position is the correct one.  Going on and on about how someone is paid by the PRC is doing nothing for your position.   Why don't you address his points instead of launching ad hominem attacks?  You've made your point that you think he's a paid shill, now engage intellectually or shut up.</p>

<p>It's also the opinion of every country in the world. The Tibetans didn't get an explicit consent to be a part of China but neither did the people of every state in the US get a choice whether their state is to be part of the US. That's a red herring.</p>

<p>Yes, your argument is in fact a red herring.  And a fat juicy one at that.  Even the southern states opted to fully rejoin the union (although I will concede it was a little like the situation in Tibet) after the civil war.  What you are implying is that what, every generation should have a vote on what country they want to be part of?  If that were to take place, the US would still very likely have 50 states.  China would be TIbetless.</p>

<p>I think that if every generation had a vote on what country they'd be part of, Hong Kong might leave China but I believe that in Tibet, it will be either a very close match or they will not leave.</p><p>Of course I could be wrong. Remember that migrants are not representative of whole populations. There are some Mandarin speaking Tibetans that I've met who are not pro independence. But from what I remember I think the Dalai Lama doesn't support complete independence either. </p>

<p>You are absolutely incorrect; unlike Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia, which have been flooded with Han colonists over the last two centuries until they are, respectively, 45% and 85% Han, Tibet remains well over 80% ethnically Tibetan. Even leaving aside religious issues, those Tibetans constitute an abused majority with little more political and economic power than Africans had under Apartheid. Direct racism isn't as prevalent, but the sheer prevalence of the security state and the automatic suspicion it exercises towards non-Han people in Tibet put the worst excesses of Stop-and-Frisk to shame.</p><p>Put it to a vote and I guarantee they'd leave in a heartbeat, but Beijing understandably cannot consider the possibility as the Tibetan Plateau contains the headwaters for the river systems which supply three-quarters of a billion people with water and food. What it would do, if it was even vaguely reasonable on the issue, is try to treat the locals well enough that they wouldn't feel the need to leave, just as it should be doing in Xinjiang, which it similarly *must* control in order to secure overland access to energy resources from Central Asia and Russia.</p>

<p>What rose-colored glasses you see the world through...</p><p>You are aware that both Xinjiang and Tibet are limited police states with the vast majority of the police and government posts being manned by Han Chinese and the Uighurs and Tibetans being treated as a distrusted and oppressed enemy by the police and army?</p><p>You are aware that economic development in these two regions is concentrated among the Han settlers and their descendants, to the point where most of Xinjiang's impressive economic growth over the last fifteen years hasn't made it to the people who lived there fifteen years ago?</p><p>I've been to Xinjiang and had friends go to Tibet; things are not so perfect as you want to delude yourself into believing.</p><p>I realize that China has legitimate security concerns that essentially require them to exercise control over the two regions, but if they want to do so they should at least treat the people who live there with a bare modicum of decency, which they currently do not do to any great extent. Talking about their "affirmative action" programs is like talking about putting a band-aid over the wound of a gunshot victim.</p>

<p>It would be a moot point, anyway. A "free" Tibet, like a "free" Xinjiang, would be a client state of China. All the significant logstical links and markets are there, and the Han control all the businesses. They might have a freer government, like Mongolia, but that's about it- Mongolia is also pretty much a wholly-owned subsidiary of China, Inc. (or at least a three-quarters owned subsidiary).</p>

<p>There are already independent countries with a similar cultural background to Tibet and Xin Jiang such as Bhutan and Uzbekistan.</p><p>Look I don't give a damn if they become independent but I just think a lot of pro-West commentators use 'free Tibet' as an excuse to screw with countries that aren't soft colonies of the US.</p><p>The vast majority of people in China, regardless of area, honestly don't give a damn. But from what I know about these areas like Tibet, that are economically depressed and net tax recipients, is that many residents have good reason to want to remain as part of China economically.</p><p>BTW. Only Inner Mongolia is politically part of China, the other parts are more influenced by Russia.</p>

<p>First of all Tibet was part of the former Mongolian and Manchurian empires, which also colonized central China. The issue is that I think they consented to be part of Mongolia and Manchuria, and those cultures were historically very different from mainstream Chinese culture, but more similar to Tibet.</p><p>When the socialist revolution happened it spread to many Asian countries. If Tibet had become independent, it may have become Soviet like Mongolia. Actually, one issue with Tibet was that the US's CIA went there in the 1950s to get them to break from socialism.</p><p>A lot of the public opinion you hear about free Tibet etc. comes from people living in Nepal and India. I don't know if they're representative of Tibetans in general. </p>

<p>"The issue is that I think they consented to be part of Mongolia and Manchuria, and those cultures were historically very different from mainstream Chinese culture, but more similar to Tibet."</p><p>They did not have a vote so you don't know if they consented. I think the population and the leaders were completely against being subjugated by the Mongols. But in the case of China, at least the Dalai Lama consented during the 18th century that China had suzerainty over Tibet. See Melvyn Goldstein's book, The Snow Lion and the Dragon for example.</p>

<p>In my experience in traveling through Tibetan areas, they do want the same things Han Chinese want, adequate wages, housing, environment, and education for their children. That's top concern. Some very religious people such as monks are concerned about establishing an independent religious state or for the return of the Dalai Lama but most are far more concerned with the everyday issues.</p>

<p>There is no "conflict" between China and Tibet. Tibet is a part of China. You may not like that fact but the world doesn't revolve aorund your stupid opinions. You see, there is a thing called international law. There is no country that has denied that Tibet is a part of China. Even the Dalai Lama claims that it is a part of China. But white people like you love to speak on behalf of others.</p><p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Tibet-part-of-China-Dalai-Lama-agrees/2005/03/14/1110649129309.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/news/Wor...</a></p><p>"Tibet is a part of the People's Republic of China. It is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China. Tibetan culture and Buddhism are part of Chinese culture."</p>

<p>I'm much less interested in the substance of your talking points than observing that you are quite clearly a paid spokesperson for the People's Republic of China.  If I wanted to debate the official Chinese talking points, I could just call the embassy and talk with someone who is at least upfront about who is paying them to say what they're saying.</p><p>I mean, c'mon...there's no conflict between Tibet and China?  That's just a bridge too far, my Sino friend.</p>

<p>Great, I'm not a paid agent of the PRC so I have nothing to worry about. You can't win an argument so you have to rely on threats to report someone for expressing a different opinion from you. Even the US courts require some form of evidence which you don't have and will never get. So go ahead, sock puppet.</p>

<p>There isn't a dispute, because there's no such thing as Tibet, at least as far as the nation-state system is concerned. It would be like saying "the dispute between the US and the Lakota Nation"; the Lakota may argue that they're a conquered people whose land was taken from them, but there was never a Lakota nation-state as such that was recognized by the world. Tibet? Same.</p>

<p>It was a kingdom; not a state in the modern, westphalian-system sense. Their lack of a sense of statehood went to the point that when offered recognition by the United Nations in the late 1940s, they rejected it, insisting that they were part of China. This was the way the situation stood until it became clear to the Dalai Lama's clique in the late 50s that they wouldn't have the autonomy that they expected and had enjoyed under previous regimes and dynasties... at which point they began to retroactively claim statehood. A decade and a half too late. (Note that the ROC government on Taiwan has never rescinded their claim to Tibet or Xinjiang either- or Outer Mongolia for that matter, which is a recognized, independent state.)</p><p>It becomes increasingly evident when you look at what the Tibetan Government in Exile claims as Tibet, which includes a lot more than the Xizang rump-province; it includes all of Qinghai, which is less than a third Tibetan to begin with, and has historically had large populations of Hui, Han, and other minorities. The Dalai Lama himself was born in Gansu province, which has been recognized as part of the Chinese core going back for centuries, but contains many Tibetan villages.</p><p>The whole idea of a Tibetan "state" simply doesn't make sense when superimposed on the ethnic complexities of central Asia. Same as the various manufactured "states" of the Middle East.</p>

<p>Honestly according to the Westphalian nation-state concept, many non-Western societies were not 'states' until quite recently. But they were countries, with governments, and with an idea of being a country.</p><p>Now I'm not pro-free Tibet. but Tibet definitely had its own form of governance and was a diverse place historically.</p>

<p>Agreed. There's just so much misinformation that makes it sound like there was this "happy Shangri-la kingdom of Tibet" that was peacefully minding it's own business in Buddhist harmony when the big, bad Chinese communists invaded. Um, no. There was a patchwork of ethnic Tibetan kingdoms and communities that had been part of the Qing empire along with many other central and Southeast Asian tribes. After the fall of the Qing, they meandered their own way, sometimes under various foreign (Indian, Soviet, Chinese) influences, but remained part of the new Chinese Republic for all nominal purposes, and never really rejected it's position as Chinese territory- until it became clear that China wanted to run it as a Chinese territory, and not as a Tibetan-administered tributary sending tax revenues to Beijing in exchange for military protection. Which reminds me of another territory that's in the news a lot right now, but that's another story...</p>

<p>Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, himself a Ukrainian, "gave" Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, when all of the republics were under the umbrella of the USSR. It was not the 1970s. Before that, Crimea was regarded as Russia, particularly since so much Russian blood had been spilt there.</p>

<p>Much of the blood you are talking was spilled by native Crimean Tartars... Countless thousands were murdered by the Red Terror in 1920. Countless thousands more died of starvation in the famine of 1921/22, when the Soviets confiscated all their grain.  Tens of thousands more were murdered in the terror of 1929 in the Crimea.   Then even more during the purges of 1937/38. Then the entire population of Tartars was deported to Siberia in 1944 for collaborating with the Germans (yes..the Tartars found them easier to get along with than the Soviets), killing countless thousands more.   They eventually returned to the Crimea but in numbers far less than a few generations earlier.</p><p>You are wrong about Khrushchev being a Ukrainian.  Most school children know he was born in Kalinovka, Russia, which is near Kursk.  He was 100% Russian. He was the Soviet Commissar to the Ukraine however.  Stalin wanted another Russian keeping them under his heal.  I am assuming you are just making up facts to support him making the Crimea part of the Ukraine.  He did so primarily because all land links to the peninsula from the mainland went through the Ukraine.</p><p>Besides that, you are right.  After Russia defeated the Turks, and started eliminating the native tartars, they did achieve a majority of Russians there.</p><p>Nobody except you and other Russians feel that justifies them to invade and confiscate part of a sovereign nation however.</p>

<p>Look at the map of claim by the Chinese and see how it extends south through international waters and into the internationally ratified (200km) zones of the affected countries. <br>And in the case of one of the disputed island chains, it was owned by a Japanese national who sold to the Japanese government. <br>Here in Australia we are considering buying cutting edge submarines off the shelf from the Japanese, and the howls of protest from the Chinese have been long and loud. <br>Meanwhile they are setting up bases in Australias' designated zone within Antartica...and they've cruised their warships off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean to intimidate our government when we approved a US Marine training base in the tropical north of our country..they really do have a very unsophisticated bully streak in their behaviour..</p>

<p>Internationally ratified zones? Are you sure you know what you are talking about? Are you thinking about International waters which sometimes stretches beyond 200 nautical miles beyond the shore line (not 200 km as you claimed)?</p><p>Anyway, as for the Sino-Japanese island, it is not beyond 200 nautical miles of Chinese shores. It less than 200 nautical miles from from mainland Chinese shores and about 140 km from Taiwan and also 140 km from Ishigaki Islands and 410 km from a main Japanese island (Naha)</p>

<p>I like the subtle shift in your own statement from nautical miles when referencing *Chinese* territorial claims to kilometers when referencing other territorial claims.</p><p>I also wonder how you reconcile this argument about "main Japanese island" of Naha (thus conveniently excluding Sakishima-Sohto, despite there being towns and cities with continual populations) with the construction of Islands being used to expand territorial claims far south of Mainland China which are clearly within 200 nautical miles of the coasts of Vietnam and the Philippines. For those wondering, the closest island of the Sakishima-Soto group is 200 kilometers from the Senkaku islands, or 108 nautical miles.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? You confused km with nautical miles. I pointed that out. The Island is actually closest to Taiwan (140 km which is less than 108 nautical miles). BTW, both the Taiwanese government and the PRC claim that Taiwan is part of China.</p>

<p>Again, you're deeply confused. Anyone with a three digit IQ  can convert nautical miles to km and see that what I said is perfectly consistent. BTW, I referenced all three Japanese AND Chinese and Taiwanese claims in km. I only talked about nautical miles when I was talking about the standard LOS definition which uses nautical miles (which is there usage for general claims). You're confused because you have a double digit IQ. </p>

<p>What a bunch of rubbish.  Long claimed ?   The Philippines has given dozens of examples of those islands never being claimed.  The only major survey done of them by a chinese dynasty was done by Kublai Khan, a mongol who at the time had had conquered Korea, was invading Vietnam, was getting ready to invade Japan (stopped by the Kamakazi..divine wind), and wanted to see what else was out there to lay his hands on.</p><p>Besides that, it was a Nationalist Chinese Cartographer who whimsically put the 9-dash line on a 1946 map he was drawing.  That is the strength of the Chinese claim.   They had no settlements on the island, and it was Vietnamese, Malay, and Filipino fisherman and traders more than Chinese who plied these waters over the last 3000 years.</p><p>As far as the last 40 years... that number was put in place since it allows for the following not to be mentioned...</p><p>The Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949<br>The Chinese invasion of South Korea in 1950<br>Armed conflict with Taiwan over Matsu and Quemoy in 1958/59<br>The Chinese invasion of India in 1962<br>The Amur River conflict in 1969<br>The disastrous 1979 invasion of South Vietnam<br>Now..they are close to conflict with Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan.</p><p>Yes... throughout their 65 year history, the Chinese have been a beacon of peace.</p>

<p>as regards the islands of the south china sea and China's "claims to them":</p><p><a href="http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/world/chinas-false-memory-syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://www.prospectmagazine.co...</a></p><p>"When a Chinese government committee first gave Chinese names to the <br>islands in 1935 all it did was either translate or transliterate the <br>existing British names. In the Paracels, for example, Antelope Reef <br>became Líng yang (the Chinese word for antelope) and in the Spratlys, North Danger Reef became B?i xi?n (Chinese for “north danger”), Spratly Island became Si-ba-la-tuo<br> (the Chinese transliteration of the English name). The Chinese committee simply copied the British maps, errors and all. The names were then revised, twice. Scarborough Shoal, named after a British ship in 1748, was originally transliterated as Si ge ba luo in 1935, renamed Min’zhu Jiao—Democracy Reef by the nationalist Republic of China in 1947 and then given the less politically-sensitive name of Huangyan (Yellow Rock) by the communist People’s Republic of China in 1983...The story probably begins with the first Opium War in 1840 and what the Chinese now call the “century of national humiliation” that followed. China clearly suffered grievously at the hands of Western and <br>Japanese imperialists: thousands were killed, cities were colonised and the government fell in hock to international banks.<br>The geographer William Callahan and others have outlined how, as part of the struggle against foreign domination, nationalists and communists deliberately cultivated a sense of territorial violation to mobilise <br>the population. From the 1900s onwards, Chinese geographers such as Bai Meichu, one of the founders of the China Geography Society, began to draw maps to show the public how much territory had been torn from away <br>from China by the imperialists.</p><p>These “maps of national humiliation” assumed that China’s rightful territory included every former vassal that had once offered tribute to a Chinese emperor. They included the Korean peninsula, large areas of Russia, Central Asia, the Himalayas and many parts of Southeast Asia. Lines were drawn on these maps to contrast the vast domains of former <br>empires with the country’s shrunken state. Fatefully, after the officialChinese committee had renamed the islands in the South China Sea in 1935, one of these lines was drawn around the Sea. This is what is now called the “U-shaped” or “9-dash” line encompassing 80 per cent of the <br>Sea and all the islands within it. That cartographical accident, based on misreadings of Southeast Asian history, is the basis for China’s current claim of sovereignty.</p><p>China clearly suffered abuse at the hands of domineering foreigners but the modern state that emerged from the rubble of the Qing Dynasty and the subsequent civil wars has found solace in false memories that bear little relation to what actually happened. As any visitor to the new “Road to Revival” exhibition at the National Museum of China in <br>Tiananmen Square will discover, this false memory syndrome is a critical ingredient in the legitimising myth of the Communist Party: that it saved the nation from humiliation.</p>

<p>This list is absurd if anybody knows anything.  But just one example, China invaded India in 1962?</p><p>Sure the Indian has been saying this for a long time, and they still insist that they are just hapless innocent victim against big bad China.  In fact at the time of the incident, the West overwhelmingly take the Indian line.  After all isn't India a democracy and China a Communist nation and that's the end of the story?</p><p>Nowadays a body of works has emerged and challenge this narrative and they give a quite convincing evidence that it is India who is the belligerent.  Here are two links for anyone who is interested.</p><p><a href="http://gregoryclark.net/redif.html" rel="nofollow">http://gregoryclark.net/redif....</a></p><p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/news-events/podcasts/renewed-tension-indiachina-border-whos-blame" rel="nofollow">http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/...</a></p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't say that China has "no soft power."  Actually, I did write that at first but edited it almost immediately.  Much has been written about China's attempts to cultivate soft power.  At the risk of posting a TLDR reply, I'm going to quote below some excerpts from an article in Foreign Policy that I think elucidates what I mean when I say China suffers from a "lack of diplomacy and soft power".</p><p>Before I do, I just want to remark that it seems to me that much of the cheering for China around the world has not at its core an enthusiasm for Chinese culture or policy, but a desire to see an abatement of the power of the United States.  This is in marked contrast to American soft power.  I've lived in Turkey, a country with some of the highest disapproval rates of US foreign policy in the world.  Yet everywhere I went, people were genuinely delighted to meet an American (even in Istanbul where drunkenly partying Westerners are a common annoyance).  During every conversation I had about world events, I was emphatically informed that Turkish people liked Americans, even though they disliked the actions of our government.</p><p>That's soft power.</p><p>When I met my wife's cousin, a senior engineer tasked with retrofitting Istanbul's buildings for earthquake preparedness, an Herculean effort that should give some clue to his level of intelligence, he was beside himself with glee to sit down and chat with an American.  My poor wife could hardly keep up the translation with all the things he wanted to say.  One thing in particular stuck with me.  He said that a Turk like my wife could go to America and become an American.  But the Turks whose great grandparents went to Germany still aren't Germans.</p><p>That's also soft power.</p><p>People around the world watch Hollywood movies (and complain about them as much as we do, but still watch them--like we do), listen to our pop music, watch our tv shows, and read gossip about our celebrities.  There's a disconcertingly huge gap in their understanding of how our society works, but nevertheless they have a direct connection with us through our culture.</p><p>Again, soft power.</p><p>Despite China's efforts to fund projects in third world countries, there's just no parallel between global attitudes toward China and the examples I cited above.</p><p>Ok, here's some more thoughts on soft power from Harvard professor Joseph S. Nye from that FP article:</p><p></p><blockquote>The soft power of a country rests primarily on three resources: its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority).<br><br>Much of America's soft power is produced by civil society -- everything from universities and foundations to Hollywood and pop culture -- not from the government. Sometimes the United States is able to preserve a degree of soft power because of its critical and uncensored civil society even when government actions -- like the invasion of Iraq -- are otherwise undermining it. <br><br>Even China's soft-power triumphs, such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics, have quickly turned stale. Not long after the last international athletes had departed, China's domestic crackdown on human rights activists undercut its soft power gains. Again in 2009, the Shanghai Expo was a great success, but it was followed by the jailing of Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo and screens were dominated by scenes of an empty chair at the Oslo ceremonies.<br><br>China and Russia make the mistake of thinking that government is the main instrument of soft power. In today's world, information is not scarce but attention is, and attention depends on credibility. Government propaganda is rarely credible. The best propaganda is not propaganda. For all the efforts to turn Xinhua and China Central Television into competitors to CNN and the BBC, there is little international audience for brittle propaganda. As the Economist noted about China, "the party has not bought into Mr. Nye's view that soft power springs largely from individuals, the private sector, and civil society. So the government has taken to promoting ancient cultural icons whom it thinks might have global appeal." But soft power doesn't work that way. As Pang Zhongying of Renmin University put it, it highlights "a poverty of thought" among Chinese leaders. </blockquote><p></p><p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/what_china_and_russia_don_t_get_about_soft_power" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/a...</a></p>

<p>I don't know about reading, writing, and speaking, but I'd certainly rather type in English.  We don't even have to worry about diacriticals, let alone logosyllabic scripts.</p><p>But you raise an excellent point that relates to soft power.  English is the global lingua franca of business and science and technology.  The historical reasons why this is so are obvious.  But having taught English abroad, I also think there are some intrinsic reasons why English accounts for 60% of all foreign language learning in the world.</p><p>English has a reputation as one of the more difficult languages in the world to master because of non-phonetic spellings, idioms, homonyms, homophones, homographs, lack of any central authority over usages, and the sheer number of words, including archaic, technical, and scientific terminology, among other reasons.</p><p>This depth of vocabulary is not a weakness, it's a strength.  It makes English more efficient.  When the same block of text is issued in multiple languages, the English version is nearly always the shortest one since there's usually a word that perfectly conveys the meaning, rather than the wordy work-arounds other languages often have to employ.</p><p>Despite English's reputation for being tough to master, it's also considered one of the easiest languages to start learning and using at a beginner/intermediate level.  Here are some reasons why English is considered one of the easiest languages to learn (but not master):</p><p>Verb conjugation: A typical French verb has more than fifty endings that must be learned. A regular English verb has four.</p><p>Irregular verbs: It would take less than a page to list all irregular forms of all irregular verbs in English, as compared with sixteen pages for Spanish. All English irregular verbs except “to be” and “to have” are irregular in the same way.</p><p>English noun and adjectival forms:  Unlike most other European languages, nouns are not more or less arbitrarily divided as being “masculine,” “feminine,” or “neuter.” Adjectives need not change to match noun gender form, nor do they change if a noun is plural.</p><p>Written versus spoken forms: Some languages, including French, German, and Greek, among others are very different in their formal written and casual spoken forms. English is not one of these.</p><p></p>

<p>That was my post, I'm Duncan.  I edited it and for some reason it's now by Guest.</p><p>Hey there...Disqus.  You didn't just become self-aware did you?  If so I take back everything I ever wrote about you.  I swear I didn't mean any of it.</p><p>[edit:   I'm really bummed that now I won't be getting credit for using "diacriticals" and "logosyllabic" in the same sentence.

<p>Not all Guest posts are mine.  I made the smart a$$ reply, "Thank you, um...honored guest." but I didn't type "Well stated Duncan..." Geez, how egomaniacal do you think I am?</p><p>Don't answer that please.</p><p>[edit, wait a minute, are you seeing both PW and my reply to him as Guest also?  I'm just curious if Disqus is so buggy it's showing Guest to one user and not another.  For reference, PW starts:  "I'm not so sure. Tell all the Africans..." and my reply "I certainly wouldn't say that China has.."  Those are the two posts above Manny Chen's.  If you're seeing those as "done by a poster named 'Guest', too."  then Disqus is even more messed up than I thought.</p><p></p>

<p>I see them as posted by "Guest"; both of them.<br>Till you mentioned that one of the "Guest" posts was yours, I would not have thought it was you. No, I did not think you were applauding yourself - but just wanted to be sure. Yes, Disqus seems to have been "infiltrated" by the 50 cents army, as well as the 30 rubles army on other blogs, just to mess with our liberal, democratic, capitalist, American minds (or what passes for that)...</p>

<p>Gaah!  I replied to you and then I thought I should add a "who are", which I contracted to oops can't type it because Disqus thought I was using a bad word and now my comment is waiting to be approved and we all know that means it's gone forever.</p><p>Copy/paste from that post:</p><p>The fact that we're seeing different users as Guest makes this a much stranger and more troubling problem.  If you're correct that it's the troll armies <i><b>WHO ARE</b></i> behind this, and not the Thetans that were my first guess, then that would really suck.  As bad as The Atlantic comments can be, this site is miles above most of the other news and commentary sites on the interweb.</p>

<p>If those little trolls can get into well-protected bank networks, as they have repeatedly done so recently, I fail to see how Disqus could even present a mediocre challenge to them.<br>But yes, other forums being what they are, the Atlantic's forum is actually not that bad, at all. Even previously decent ones have degenerated into smoke filled biker (leftist and/or rightist) bars where it's not worth one's time and effort to enter, unless one has an inordinate fondness for senseless howling and baying coupled with vicious brawls, without any hope of a reasonable outcome for anyone...</p>

<p>It seems the powers that be (or the little trolls) read our little exchange and thought it better to correct the screwup we discussed. I just saw that your name, and that of the other poster (albertocane) have been restored to the mentioned posts. Wow, we were/are monitored and we have the proof of it, too. I salute (with one finger) their interest in our exchange... Thanks Disqus, or whoever...</p>

<p>Chinese infrastructure in Africa is great if you need to drive from an oilfield to an oil refinery to an oil port while avoiding any major cities or trade routes. The locals are good enough to dig ditches but the Chinese require imported labor for precise, delicate work like basic construction. They do send a lot of money for housing development and you can see that it's working - the officials who collect it develop much larger houses.</p><p>China is about as popular in Africa as the United Fruit Company was in Central America.</p>

<p>"he locals are good enough to dig ditches but the Chinese require imported labor for precise, delicate work like basic construction."</p><p>Depends. Dambisa Moyo found out otherwise- in countries with underdeveloped labor forces, like Angola or Mozambique, this was generally true- Chinese employees either equalled or outnumbered African employees on projects. OTOH, in countries with more developed labor forces, like Senegal, Ghana or Botswana, Chinese were generally outnumbered by Africans 20:1 or 30:1. If the locals have the talents they need, which in the more educated nations they do, they hire them. If they don't, they import them.</p><p>"They do send a lot of money for housing development and you can see that it's working - the officials who collect it develop much larger houses."</p><p>Sub-Saharan African nations with a lot of Chinese investment are suddenly posting GDP growth rates in the 8-10% range. Why is that?</p><p>Chinese projects are denominated in RMB. You know what the great thing about RMB is? It's non-transferrable, and only useful for importing goods from China or construction contracts. Unlike Euros or Dollars, which can be smuggled offshore by elites, used to buy expensive luxury products or offshore real estate. So suddenly the influx of RMB is plugging the leaky sieve of "free trade", and igniting the local economies.</p><p>Check out Dambisa Moyo or Deborah Brautigam's works for the full story of why China's popularity has risen in Africa.</p>

<p>It is not the weapons that demonstrate seriousness, but the willingness to use them... Not the same, at all. Some European countries have nuclear weapons, but no testicles to use them, ever. It is not the gun in the hand that will defend against an aggressor/attacker, but the will to pull the trigger...</p>

<p>I am not sure what you mean, but my point was simple: the will to confront an aggressor is more important than anything else. I am much more concerned about that, than any new spending on weapons. We can spend all we have if we do not have the will to use those brand new very expensive and oh-so-impressive weapons. Confronting a bully has nothing to do with toys, but everything to do with the will to do it.</p>

<p>You might have missed the two last military engagements we had been involved in, Iraq and Afghanistan, but I seriously doubt that there is anyone, including the Iraqis and the Afghans, who would doubt that we, the US, had by far the best and most weapons in either military theater, and I don't really think it is in doubt that, we did not accomplish the military aims we had when we got involved in either country. We were not willing to do what was needed to accomplish our missions we set out to accomplish at the beginning of the hostilities. I really don't think that the point I made has not been sufficiently demonstrated by the adduced examples. So, again, it is not the weapons at all, but the will to fight is what matters. We, the US, have both the qualitative and the quantitative edge over the Chinese when it comes to any military metric, save the number of troops, but that is immaterial in the naval theater we are discussing here; and we will maintain that qualitative and quantitative edge for many years to come - the will to fight I am not sure about at all...</p>

<p>That is a rather bold take on history. To suggest that those who could not muster either the courage or the will to defeat "small less developed countries" will all the sudden find the courage and will to defeat large developed countries is far, very far from being credible; or anywhere near realistic. You are merely being mulish and resorting to caviling and what not; and you have not presented anything at all to support your take on the matter. Go ahead and keep on believing whatever you like, that is your prerogative...</p>

<p>1. No, testicles are not sine qua non for killing a lot of    <br>    people. There are many examples in history where a lot <br>    of killing was done by, or ordered by folks without a 'Y' <br>    chromosome; or even with a 'Y' chromosome but no <br>    testicles...<br>2. I used "testicles", the word, as a metaphor for resolute <br>    determination to do whatever is necessary, even if it <br>    involves killing a lot of people. Whether you like my <br>    metaphor or not, is your business, not mine; but thanks <br>    for sharing.<br>3. Don't flatter yourself that, expressing what you like or <br>    you don't like, regarding my beliefs, will make me want to<br>    express myself in a way that would meet your approval, <br>    and/or liking. But, again, if you feel the need to share, <br>    that is your prerogative, and I don't really mind.</p>

<p>Actually, the Chinese had quite a few of those, too, and not a few of them lead armies, or naval squadrons, very successfully. It was the court eunuchs who ran China pretty much up until the turn of the 20th century - or the last Emperor - when the practice was discontinued. Eunuchs in the employ of the Sultans were mostly employed as harem guards, while in China they wielded actual, real power; administrative as well as military.</p>

<p>The American and Japanese forces used to be large in West Pacific, but now they are small. It is not that the US and Japan got shrunk, it  is the other side that grew bigger.<br>The only way to have peace is to have Western forces large enough to reliably deter aggression. This is not easy considering that China is much larger than the US in human resources and roughly the same size economically. Small countries when threatened rely on universal draft, which gives them large reserves in case of need.<br>Asia would be much more peaceful if American reservists were coming there once a year with reserve ships and aircraft to train and check what is going on there.</p>

<p>Oh for God's sake. Here (sigh) yet again, we have another jingoistic article by America's chicken-hawk armchair warriors, whining about "how awful it is that China, might want to dominate the South CHINA Sea".</p><p>Stop to think about that one, for a second or two. The CHINESE want to "dominate" the CHINA Sea... and America, a country located thousands of miles to the east, literally on the other side of the world, is fulminating with indignation at this "affront".</p><p>America -- the country that has, for over 200 years, famously (via the Monroe Doctrine) violently resisted the establishment of ANY non-American great power military relationship in the Western Hemisphere -- is now shrieking outrage at the idea that the Chinese, might actually want to "dominate" a body of water that is right off the coasts of Shanghai... while American nuclear-armed battle fleets cruise up and down that sea, just spoilin' for a fight.</p><p>What, pray tell, do you think the American reaction would be, if the Chinese were, for example, sailing ships and submarines, all armed to the teeth with deliverable thermonuclear weapons, up and down the Sea of Cortes, or maybe off the coasts of Big Sur and Long Island?</p><p>Tell you what, America -- how about you withdraw your battle fleets from the South CHINA Sea, and the Chinese will promise not to start sailing the same, within spittin' distance of Malibu or Martha's Vineyard.</p><p>How about that? Sound like a deal?</p>

<p>Let's actually come up with a useful analogy here, if we're going to use analogies.</p><p>Let us say that the United States is a rising power, expanding economically for the first time in about two centuries after being kicked around as a colonial battlefield by everyone with a navy for a long period of time. We HATE... let's say Colombia... because they invaded us a 70 years ago and we're good at holding a grudge. Futhermore, we regard Mexico, Canada, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and EVERYTHING ELSE around us as little more than wayward vassal states who'd best get the h*ll back in line, or else. We have irredentist claims on territory with almost every nation we border, and we throw our weight around, frankly bullying the hell out of anyone we think can't stand up to us. Furthermore, we have a domestic historical and media narrative that reads like a German propaganda piece in 1935, and an utterly opaque and somewhat unstable government that views foreign policy as a tool in maintaining domestic power. Do you think the global powers that be in this situation wouldn't regard us as a legitimate threat to peace in our corner of the world?</p>

<p>a better summation i couldn't have come up with. Bravo!</p><p>But, no really: you hit the nail on the head when you stated that in the PRC, all foreign policy is in actuality domestic policy. It dovetails nicely with the fact that the PRC spends more on its internal security apparatus than it does its military. This is further backed up by the fact that the PRC is constantly generating foreign enemies in order to defuse domestic discontent. Protests in Hong Kong? They must be bought and paid for by the west. Philippines, Vietnam et al arresting poachers and illegal fishermen within their mandated EEZs? They must be part of a broader coalition to choke off the PRC's rise.</p><p>Small wonder then, with this kind of jingoistic narrative repeated over and over again, that despite having the second highest military spending in the world and safely being able to contest all of their neighbors, they still regard themselves as a victim; they've scared themselves into it, and they're quite good at being completely bipolar, too.</p>

<p>don't know why Indonesia is not discussed more in these conversations about east Asian geopolitics.  they have a huge population, a large land mass, and they control a lot of the navigable waterways from the Indian Ocean into these disputed areas.  also happens to be a Muslim country.</p><p>China has a lot to deal with.  the environment could collapse before any of this territorial stuff matters.</p>

<p>If the US do not beef up their West Pacific presence, it will be like Eastern Europe in 1939. Someone will come and grab it. Nature abhors vacuum and aggressive dictatorial regimes abhor weak neighbors not taken over yet. <br>It was all explained by Winston Churchill about 80 years ago so it is a choice of either read or replay.</p>

<p>I was on Palawan in May.  I spent a lot of time there as a matter of fact.  I did not see any Korean, Vietnamese or Chinese signs anywhere. I'm sure there must have been a few I did not notice, but nothing like the author claims.  The "rickshaws" he is talking about are called trikes, and they are ubiquitous in the Philippines.</p><p>I'm assuming the author is simply making this up to add to spice to his story.</p>

<p>I find it depressing that this article only provides two or three paragraphs focused on the actual driver of Chinese foreign policy, that is, Chinese domestic politics.</p><p>There are two core issues which drive foreign provocations under Xi's government. First, looking at his policies from the standpoint of intraparty factionalism: Quite frankly, Xi himself is NOT popular with the PLA. He's the leading figure in a faction of the CCP which seeks to curb (to some extent, anyway) the corruption and ridiculous abuse of authority. His initiatives and campaigns span the whole party, but the PLA's leadership represents a concentration of the sort of behavior he is attempting to reign in and they therefore intensely dislike him. This is compounded by the fact that his faction has its roots in the relatively prosperous and well-educated urban classes and its leaders are mostly descendants of former Party high-ups (hence the name "Princelings"), which means that the mostly dirt-poor, rural enlisted personnel and NCO's of the PLA also dislike (perhaps "hate" is a better word) him and his faction.</p><p>Thus, the PLA represents the only center of power in the Party with the strength and cohesiveness to upend his reform agenda, or, if the generals sense that he poses an existential threat to them and their privilege, to go beyond channels and remove or sideline him entirely. His pandering to nationalist sentiments in his foreign policy is at least in part driven by his need to keep the allegiance of the army's low- and mid-ranking personnel, who are generally poorly or moderately educated and thus rabidly nationalist. If he can keep them onboard, he can thwart any attempts by the PLA leadership to scuttle his anti-corruption drives or threaten his own person and leadership, making them fear that their sword will turn in their hand if they strike a blow with it.</p><p>Secondly, from a broader societal standpoint: Chinese economic growth over the last 30 years has provided sufficient "bread and circuses" to most of the urban population to keep them onboard with the program. In short, the current Chinese social contract with the urban populace reads: "you get a continually higher standard of living, and we keep political control." This is no longer sustainable in the cities as economic growth starts to slow and the massive inequalities and structural flaws which arose in those 30 years become apparent.</p><p>Yet, even most of the urban population is still not educated particularly well, and very few are cosmopolitan or open in the sense that many Americans and most Europeans are. Pandering to their nationalist sensibilities still *works*, and in the absence of continued double-digit economic growth, it can ensure urban support for continued Party rule despite them having shuffled political liberalization to the back burner and then turning off the stove. With the Party not only being assertive abroad but also prosecuting a moderately effective (if slow) crackdown on corruption at home, it can probably ensure relative urban stability and support for or acquiescence to continued Party rule.</p><p>The rural picture is even more complicated; rural areas have seen only a fraction of the economic growth and development of urban ones, but because of that their educational systems lag severely and are much more propagandized. This means that the best ways to keep them in line are to play to their nationalist and xenophobic instincts and promote the image of the Party as a caring and kind uncle to the masses; the former is covered by Chinese belligerence abroad, especially towards traditional enemies that rural residents have been encouraged to hate by their own elders and a heavily propagandized reading of history, while the latter is fulfilled through the current anti-corruption campaigns.</p><p>In short, Chinese belligerence abroad and the resulting poor relations with the neighbors is the price that Xi has to pay to find a way of replacing rapid economic growth as the primary support for Party legitimacy. Party rule will stand or fall on its ability to control its own corruption (for which Xi needs the support of the PLA's rank and file) and keep Chinese ultranationalists contented without actually provoking a war. Thus, we have saber rattling all over the Chinese periphery, because the leadership of the Party simply do not care about foreign opinion or goodwill at present. It is a luxury they cannot afford: their entire system is balanced on a knife's edge, and with it their power, and the only people with the power to affect it live within China's borders.</p>

<p>Oh, I see. Then, how do you like being a grad student there? I am guessing you are getting your degree in Chinese (literature, language, history, etc.). You must find it amusing/exasperating to read the rather inaccurate pictures presented of China by both the Western and Chinese posters. Some do it out of ignorance, and some do it out of malice... You could easily tell them apart, couldn't you?</p><p>P.S. Your reference to Maslow's hierarchy made me think that you taught there; being a grad student makes sense, too.</p>

<p>It's an interesting experience, but I'm actually a civil engineering student, not a humanities one. Generally speaking the quality of the education is good (I'm at one of the better engineering schools here), and the students are driven, but the culture is really different, obviously.</p><p>As for Maslow, I'm an engineering student but I went to an undergraduate university that has pretty intensive humanities requirements, so...</p><p>And yes, watching how China and the West portray themselves and each other is entertaining. Even more entertaining (and terrifying) still, though, is watching how Japan and China portray themselves and each other. The gap in perceptions is incredible.</p>

<p>Oh, that's interesting. I have never met (on the Internet or anywhere else) a Westerner who went to China to study advanced engineering (any kind). We started getting Chinese (PRC) grad students in my department (physics) in the early '80s, but never heard of anyone (Westerner) getting a PhD in physics in China. The same was true in the Engineering departments, too. Meaning, they were coming to the US, and not the other way around. Of course, by now it is a different setup, because the Chinese have done some really large scale civil engineering projects (trains, bridges, dams, etc.) in the last few decades, so they seem to know what they are doing. I am curious, though. Is the instruction in Chinese or in English? It may sound funny, but all the physicists and chemists from  the PRC I had contact with indicated that, higher level science books, and the concomitant lecturing using those books, were in English. This had more to do with linguistics than anything else. I am genuinely curious. Or, you have mastered Mandarin to the level, where you not only follow lectures in Mandarin, but read graduate level texts in it. Rather nice. Your field must be quite specialized because I haven't heard of many post docs getting positions from Chinese universities. They want to come here for grad school. Well, at least the ones I came across. I do not meant to belittle the Chines higher education at all, but am just curious and I have had some personal experience with Chinese (PRC and ROC, too) grad students. That's all. Anyway, One learns something new every day...</p>

<p>I'd like to commend you on that post; article worthy. I've read "The Diplomat" et al for some time, which was how I first got in on the IR scene (history graduate here). I came to roughly the same conclusion in my readings, though I had always thought that the military was in collusion with Xi--that is, the whole mechanism substituting ultra-nationalism and irredentism for economic and social progress--rather than the military being divided upon itself.</p><p>In that line, however, I have a question: with all the sabre-rattling and irredentism (genuine or a facade) that's been going on, what do you believe are the chances that any of this could spark a military conflict; at what point does it become the preferable option for the CPC in order to satisfy domestic nationalism that they themselves have stirred up?</p>

<p>What you're asking actually contains two separate questions, essentially, "what are the chances of a war starting by accident?" and "what are the chances of a war starting on purpose?".</p><p>The latter's simpler: the CCP knows damned well that it currently can't even defeat Japan, let alone Japan+US+allies. Thus, there are only two conditions under which China would intentionally start a war in the Western Pacific. First, if the economic climate is so horrific that losing foreign trade would change nothing anyway and the CCP needs the distraction, i.e. a Second Great Depression scenario. Secondly, if the CCP is overthrown by ultranationalists. Even a military coup wouldn't result in a war against the US and allies, as the PLA knows just as well as the CCP that they'd lose, and badly; the rabid nationalists, on the other hand, are operating under the delusion that they could win such a war.</p><p>The former is more complex; it's entirely possible that one of these incidents will end up in shooting or a collision or something else that neither side can afford to ignore if the voters/masses aren't going to throw the government out on their *sses. The most likely place for this to happen is in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, because Japan is by far the most powerful of the countries sparring with China on its periphery, and the most closely integrated into the American defense umbrella, thus it's the boldest. It's also the one China dislikes most strongly, which means that China's domestic opinion won't allow the CCP to back down.</p><p>The Philippines and Vietnam are much less likely to court an incident than Japan, but unfortunately, because they're much less able to defend themselves, the Chinese are much more likely to push them into a corner where they feel they have no recourse but to back the decisions of the people on scene no matter the consequences, especially Vietnam, whose links with the US are fragile and untested, as yet.</p><p>Nonetheless, I don't rate the chances of an actual war coming out of this as being very high; the Chinese do NOT want to take on Japan or the US, which means they cannot go after Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan, or the Philippines and will soft-ball any incidents which arise to the greatest extent they possibly can. The most likely war scenario is a bilateral war between China and Vietnam which sees Vietnam swept from the seas and China's naval development kicked back 5-10 years by Vietnamese ex-Soviet submarines.</p>

<p>I agree with your post and appreciate your insight.  however, i tend to view the environment as China's major problem.  obviously this is connected with the economy of China, but I can't see how the degradation can continue into the future, even if the growth rate slows dramatically.  so much damage has already been done.</p><p>people will have to deal with the pollution long after the Party is booted out for a sluggish and corrupt economy...</p>

<p>I'm not dismissing the pollution as a serious issue, not by any stretch. In fact, I expect that environmental degradation will be the most serious challenge facing China by 2030, far surpassing a graying population and the challenges of creating a domestic market big enough to absorb its productive capacity.</p><p>However, the majority of China's people are low enough on Maslow's hierarchy that they literally couldn't care less about long-term environmental degradation. The only places which care to any great extent are the major cities beset by severe air pollution. As such, pollution represents no great threat to the CCP's legitimacy in the eyes of most Chinese, so I completely ignored it above as it doesn't play into their foreign policy at all.</p>

<p>1) This was a by the numbers recitation of the conventional wisdom.  This article includes exactly one fact I -- a moderately interested layman -- didn't already know.  Well, maybe two: I had no idea Vietnamese diplomats could be so droll.</p><p>2) If the U.S. is going to have alliances in the region, we best be ready to throw down for them.  Strategic ambiguity won't work wrt China.</p><p>If we're willing to go to war to protect the Philippines, or Taiwan, or Japan then we need to be loud and clear about it; if we're not, then we shouldn't leave anyone with that impression.</p><p>Being seen as guaranteeing another nation's security when we're not willing to actually do it is a lose/lose position.</p><p>3) This is reason 663 to not treat China like a regular country.  This is a country that executes political prisoners to harvest their organs.  China should be facing the sort of sanctions usually associated with Iran, North Korea, and Saddam's Iraq.</p><p>That whole 'constructive engagement' approach is a huge failure (unless of course one supposes it's real purpose was to provide cover for companies seeking to make money by trading with China.  And by trading with I mean exploiting the cheap labor supply.  In that case it was a total success).</p>

<p>China's position is no different from US position in early 20 century when Great Brittan was sizing the US up for a war. It was avoided when US, Japan, and Great Britain signed naval treaty. Democracy was not a factor. History never repeats itself but rhyme.</p>

<p>Where in the world did you get the idea that the UK wanted to go to war against the US at any point during the 20th century? The treaty you're speaking of was designed to contain German and Japanese naval construction, so there wouldn't be a repeat of the bankrupting Dreadnought race that led up to the Great War. </p>

<p>Both Southeastern Asian claimants and the US are using each other for their perspective gains; for the U.S. geopolitical leverage against China and for the smaller flies in the southeast Asian claimants and Japan (in East China Sea dispute with China) a perceived deterrent or protection in the case of Japan and the Philippines. The danger is that some small flies (like the Serb guy in Sarajevo) could cause mighty nations to go to self-destructive war like that in Europe in 1914 (which cost Britain superpower status and losing its grip on its colonies worldwide); that same thing could happen to the US as well albeit "exceptional" or "near chosen," if the US is not careful.</p>

<p>Great Article however, the author never discussed "soft power" and the cultural relationship that Japan and the United States share with each<br>other. Americans (those who know the difference between China and Japan)<br>overwhelmingly despise China and have multiple cultural ties to Japanese<br>culture. The true and final question is: Are Americans willing to die for<br>Tokyo? Beijing thinks not but, I’m willing to wager that Beijing is wrong. The<br>next few Aircraft carriers we decommission should be gifted to Japan. The President<br>should visit the Yaukuni Shrine along with the UK and Australian Prime Ministers.<br>There is no reason why China, a morally bankrupt oppressive dictatorship should<br>be anything besides a pariah in the eyes of the international community. The<br>Dalai Lama still cannot return home, Tibet is not free, Hong Kong is oppressed,<br>and the South China sea is not for sale.</p>

<p>It is a cliche that autocrats seek (or create) an external enemy when feeling threatened.  Jst now Xi Jiping is confronting democracy-minded students in Hong Kong and an economy that may be in impending meltdown.  So go to the playbook and do what works.</p>

<p>You care to present evidence of why he's wrong?</p><p>The CCP is balanced on a knife's edge and one of the supports they rely on to stay up is pandering to nationalism. If they lose a small war on their periphery, it'd be catastrophic for their efforts to maintain control. Even worse would be backing down from one in the face of American or Japanese power, which may well see them thrown out of power within a year.</p>

<p>China is cruising for a bruising. Sure they can bully all these small countries around, but collectively and internationally this will pay sour dividends in the future in the form of plenty of bad blood, ill relations and put a drag on their economy while the demographics of their aging population will make it harder for the country to grow. They have a billion mouths to feed and they have stirred the pot of nationalism to such an extent that any reversal of their fortunes is likely to be very dangerous. They have painted themselves in a corner in the South China Sea. It's perhaps only a matter of time before something happens.</p><p>It seems the Chinese leadership must feel they are ready to resume their position as the hegemon of Asia if not the world, new Sun Emperors. They want to create a new China centric world order, throwing out the one arrived at by western powers over the centuries.  Having recently visited there and worked with them for some time I know they are very self confident even if they have little to be self confident about. I saw this first had while the  smog stung my eyes closed on the Bund and while watching people working night and day on huge new office towers (with out the need to find tenants to occupy them).  This is still a poor country with workers walking around with tree branches fashioned as brooms to clean the streets, bicycles go down the road with couches and huge loads of Styrofoam to recycle. Instead of working with the existing system they are working to create a new one with the likes of Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Putin likes to see Russia as a great power and not the oil kleptocracy it has become where his friends shake down any successful business and steal their companies. Hitching the future of Russia to China is likely to be as successful a strategy as that of Polish Foreign Minister Beck who thought he could form an alliance with Hitler in 1939. In reality Russia could become a satellite of China or perhaps play Mussolini to Xi's Hitler. In any case, Putin is knucklehead to think Russia will not get rolled like everyone else in Beijing.</p>

<p>Apparently the Chinese commenters here also like Western names, which they adopt as readily as China copies everything else. Are you ashamed of your own names?</p>

<p>I noticed the standard map of China you see on the walls of restaurants and hotels everywhere had to be shrunk down dramatically in scale in order to fit the "nine-dash-line". No special inset like Alaska\Hawaii in American maps. They were only able to show half the content that would fit on the sheet otherwise.</p>

<p>We (U.S.) should make a temporary strategic withdrawal from the Western Pacific.  If China's threat is real, this will create fear and worry among other countries in the region.  Without the guaranteed U.S. protective umbrella, they will feel more threatened by China, and will strengthen their militaries and form alliances among themselves.  These alliances, likely led by Japan and India, will be able to present a strong counterweight to China's potential aggression.   With such strong allies, and providing them additional material and reserve forces, we will be able to easily overcome any threat in the area.</p><p>Same strategy applies to our Russian worries.</p><p>I know, withdrawing seems counter-intuitive and weak.  However, often times it is the best move.  By making a temporary strategic withdrawal, we will secure our position in the long run.</p><p>Think of the way a good player plays chess.  He/she will just as willingly move a piece back, if it strategically beneficial.  Being emotionally attached to any particular position, whether forward or rear, is a huge mistake.</p>

<p>Because their so called leaders are as corrupt as H***. they have been bought out by the almighty US dollar decades ago. The leaders' interests are not intent on the benefits of their populations but on their own bank accounts. America has used this fact to totally subvert most of these nations.  I would have thought you knew this already.</p>

<p>Interesting isn't it? Remember just a few decades ago the Vietnamese were relying on China to prevent American aggression on their soil. At least today, China, unlike the US is not bombing the H out of them. You know it would be useful if you remembered which nation it was that killed 3 million Vietnamese not that long ago, before you start crticizing China. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones!</p>

<p>At least we remember our own history. The Chinese are enthusiastically erasing theirs, and now making up a maritime empire that never existed, and a Tibet as part of China that has scarcely any more validity.</p><p>If you ask the Vietnamese, or the Koreans, or the Tibetans, or many others of their neighbors, they'll tell you the Chinese (and the Japanese, more recently) are their perpetual invaders. Americans know what we did in Vietnam, and in Korea and the Philippines for that matter. Curious how, after all that, the Vietnamese and Koreans and Filipinos still primarily fear the Chinese and are at least intermittently fond of us.</p>

<p>There is no containment of Russia by NATO.  Since the collapse of the Russian empire former countries occupied by Russia since the days of the Czars and the end of WW II are now turning to the West because they want freedom and democracy and NATO to protect them from further Russian aggression and occupation.</p>

<p>At several points, French touches on Taiwan, which is the crucial weak link in "the first island chain." But, French is spectacularly remiss in leaving out of consideration the very important and portentous changes that have been occurring in the Taiwan-China relationship since Ma became Taiwan President in 2008. Taiwan has significantly been steadily moving closer to China. Correspondingly, Taipei's relationship with Washington has been gradually fading, especially during the simultaneous presidencies of Ma and Obama.</p><p>French says enough to show us that he knows that Taiwan is China's real <br>target, but misses the important point that Taiwan is probably also China's priority, in terms of sequence. The way I see it -- Taiwan comes first; the others, China will deal with later.</p><p>In my view, much of China's current maritime bluster is a cover for an early China move to take Taiwan. In my estimation, China will sooner or later exploit a perceived crisis with Japan to effect a surprise landing of PLA troops on Taiwan, <br>provided that there is secretly prior agreement with Kuomintang leaders, including President Ma and his top generals.</p><p> The precedent is the largely peaceful manner in which Hitler's Wehrmacht rolled into Austria in March 1938, with the active complicity of those many Austrian politicians who were either Nazis or supported the idea of union (Anschluss) with Germany. We have seen this film before, then in black-and-white but today in rich color.</p><p>PLA missiles, fighter planes and naval bases on Taiwan would break "the first island chain" and significantly degrade the strategic position of both Japan and the <br>Philippines. China's return to Taiwan is the game changer that will effectively drive the USA out of the Western Pacific.</p><p>Although French nowhere directly touches on the top Chinese leadership's <br>perception of President Obama, numerous points in his text tend to <br>substantiate a presumption that President Obama made a very poor first <br>impression during his November 2009 visit to China. This must have been <br>so, because Premier Wen Jiabao shortly thereafter went out of his way to<br> treat the USA President with great discourtesy at the December 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Summit. This was an early element of <br>China's continuing process of testing the quality of Obama's leadership.</p><p>French does believe that the top Chinese leadership perceived spectacular weakness in President Obama's policies with regard to Syria and Ukraine. However, French entirely misses the far more important point that the top Chinese leadership probably also perceive Obama to be astonishingly weak because of his very peculiar approach to Iran's race to nuclear weapons.</p><p>World leaders were amazed to see Obama unilaterally relaxing sanctions <br>upfront, and dropping agreed Security Council resolutions demanding a total <br>end to uranium enrichment by Iran -- while publicly pouring cold water <br>on any expectation that the USA might perhaps eventually have to use <br>some force to stop or delay the ayatollahs' nuclear-weapons ambitions. <br>For example, the way in which Obama publicly deplored the possibility of<br> a "fourth war with a Muslim country" not only enhanced the security and<br> confidence of the Iranians, but at the same time convinced the Chinese <br>and Russian leaders that, under Obama, the USA is well and truly just "a <br>paper tiger," as detailed by French. Nor would world leaders have missed the way that President Obama powerfully leaned on Israel to prevent it from acting alone to attack Iran's nuclear-weapons development installations.</p><p>Result? Firstly, the continuing Russian invasions of Ukraine; and secondly, the greatly accelerated ambitions of China, as ably set out in this French article.</p>
