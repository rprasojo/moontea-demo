They are responding to the containment via NATO encroaching and US destabilizing via proxy Ukraine. Crimea is merely a return of what was always Russian, and Ukraine disintegration is natural due to corruption and its proxy status against Russia. You reap what you sow, and the Hegemon is reaping reaction to its attempts to destroy the Russian Federation.\n\n\nChina may be hungry for resources, but it's maritime reach is based on historical realities. The U.S. is desperate to maintain its naval hegemony, and China is nullifying that with its carrier-killer missile threat. A new Maritime Silk Road and a proposed canal through Thailand would eliminate the Straits of Malacca as a choke point the U.S. controls. Who is trying to limit who where? Its the US trying to stop China from being a true blue water naval power. The U.S. using an imperialistic Japan to torment China, Taiwan and South Korea in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. \n\n\nThe 20th Century realities are gone. China and Russia will build a Eurasian market of over 3.5 billion people from the Far East and South Asia (India) to Russia and East Europe through Central Asia. This coming realty is what reduces the West and its corrupt EU, maniacal Nato, and collapsing American governmental tyranny to secondary position if they don't change from Hegemon to a multi-polar player.\n\n\nDig into the facts of the SCO, the New Silk Road, the Maritime Silk Road and look at the militarism of Abe's Japan and the use of the Philippines as proxy for the US. \n\n\nChina merely is the new bank for all emerging and most developing nations. A role once filled by a financially sound U.S. Now, the U.S. can only spread chaos and attempt de-stabilization to hold onto power. It's run as an empire is coming to an end. It may take ten more years, but debt will be the victor over the tyrant. The Liberals inherited the world and have destroyed it with their ideologies and wars.\n\n\nRussia and China signed strategic economic and technological agreements far beyond the big gas deal. Now they are working on space, jumbo airliner, weapons, agriculture, rail, home construction, ports, bridges, pipelines, education, IT security, oil and gas and fresh water projects, food, currency, banking and finance (substitute for SWIFT and use of the Chinese credit card system). The Far East and Siberia, and Crimea and East Ukraine (now Novorossiya) are all areas of integration of Chinese and Russian development, as well as Northeast China (Heliongjiang Province) opening up to Russia projects. \n\n\nEven India is getting Chinese investment for its infrastructure projects. If India wasn't so corrupt, they would have many more Chinese built ports and highways. The Chinese are going to modernize the India rail system.\n\n\nThe U.S. maybe thinks it can send Tweets and try to start some more color revolutions, but it has very little to offer to any but the most subservient nations.

It has its disputed regions with Japan, it has a stake in controlling the DPRK and the nuclear threat from North Korea. It has a new very strategic economic relationship with China.</p><p>How do you write a major review of the last several years of the state of the East China and South China Sea disputes and leave Russia out?</p>

<p>It does leave out Russia, but almost all of the disputes with China  are occurring far to the southeast. While Russia does have a new economic agreement with China, I suspect that may a temporary expedient to secure one front while Putin strives to rebuild the old Soviet empire in the west. In the long run, Russia is demographically fading, while China is hungry for more land and resources - all tantalizingly available north of the Amur.</p>

<p>Disagree with several of your comments. <br>Russia is not rebuilding any Soviet empire. They are responding to the containment via NATO encroaching and US destabilizing via proxy Ukraine. Crimea is merely a return of what was always Russian, and Ukraine disintegration is natural due to corruption and its proxy status against Russia. You reap what you sow, and the Hegemon is reaping reaction to its attempts to destroy the Russian Federation.</p><p>China may be hungry for resources, but it's maritime reach is based on historical realities. The U.S. is desperate to maintain its naval hegemony, and China is nullifying that with its carrier-killer missile threat. A new Maritime Silk Road and a proposed canal through Thailand would eliminate the Straits of Malacca as a choke point the U.S. controls. Who is trying to limit who where? Its the US trying to stop China from being a true blue water naval power. The U.S. using an imperialistic Japan to torment China, Taiwan and South Korea in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.</p><p>The 20th Century realities are gone. China and Russia will build a Eurasian market of over 3.5 billion people from the Far East and South Asia (India) to Russia and East Europe through Central Asia. This coming realty is what reduces the West and its corrupt EU, maniacal Nato, and collapsing American governmental tyranny to secondary position if they don't change from Hegemon to a multi-polar player.</p><p>Dig into the facts of the SCO, the New Silk Road, the Maritime Silk Road and look at the militarism of Abe's Japan and the use of the Philippines as proxy for the US.</p><p>China merely is the new bank for all emerging and most developing nations. A role once filled by a financially sound U.S. Now, the U.S. can only spread chaos and attempt de-stabilization to hold onto power. It's run as an empire is coming to an end. It may take ten more years, but debt will be the victor over the tyrant. The Liberals inherited the world and have destroyed it with their ideologies and wars.</p><p>Russia and China signed strategic economic and technological agreements far beyond the big gas deal. Now they are working on space, jumbo airliner, weapons, agriculture, rail, home construction, ports, bridges, pipelines, education, IT security, oil and gas and fresh water projects, food, currency, banking and finance (substitute for SWIFT and use of the Chinese credit card system). The Far East and Siberia, and Crimea and East Ukraine (now Novorossiya) are all areas of integration of Chinese and Russian development, as well as Northeast China (Heliongjiang Province) opening up to Russia projects.</p><p>Even India is getting Chinese investment for its infrastructure projects. If India wasn't so corrupt, they would have many more Chinese built ports and highways. The Chinese are going to modernize the India rail system.</p><p>The U.S. maybe thinks it can send Tweets and try to start some more color revolutions, but it has very little to offer to any but the most subservient nations. It is bringing down all its allies with debt and draconian Trade agreements. Look into TTIP and TTP and see how it colonizes any nation that joins. Pure hegemony in exchange for a nuclear umbrella and debt.</p>

<p>Yawn...</p><p>Oh I wish prose and thought when together but your writing belies too much anti-US bias to be taken as anything more than ranting.  But from your screed it is clear that you really don't care about 'people' or 'rights' (China and Russia!)  The Pax-China is about to end and Putin's bare chest and regressive policies are a bit hard to idolize.</p><p>But thanks for the rant - it made me laugh.</p>

<p>I did get a laugh at the dig at India's (96/177 in the 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index) level of corruption, when corruption is just as endemic in both China (80/177) and especially Russia (127/177).</p><p>(By comparison, the United States' ranking is 19/177.)</p><p>And much of the economic growth in China has been fueled by the "shadow banking" system, which is functionally the equivalent of a house of cards built on quicksand.<br>There are other signifiicant challenges to the vision of economic integration outlined above, but I can't be bothered to write a W.O.T. at the moment.</p>

<p>Matthew,</p><p>For those who believe democracy cures all, China vs India is antithesis. Also in 1979, China's GDP and India GDP were the same despite India's smaller population. Now China is almost 5 times bigger than India's (nominal GDP). No Han Chinese dissidents live in the "largest democracy." </p>

<p>Frankly, Vietnam controls most of small islands in the South China Sea, Philippine the second, China the 3rd. We should respect the fact. Everyone knows U.S. tries to contain China to guarantee strategy advantage with all possible ways, it's not a problem. But the fact is quite different.</p>

<p>Thanks for the stupid "straw man" attack.</p><p>Nobody here suggested that China is a democracy. What I and others have been saying is, American nationalists and jingoists are whining about China engaging in a very mild version of the gunboat diplomacy that has been engaged in by the United States, for over a century now. It was just fine and dandy when it was done by English-speaking white people, but oh, my goodness! We can't let those yellow Chinese play "our" little imperialist game.</p><p>Well, sorry, squire... nonsense propaganda of this type may play very well in Topeka, but it doesn't play very well at all in, say, Shanghai... not to mention Jakarta.</p>

For the benefits of everyone, Timor Leste is a newly independent nation which broke off from Indonesia a decade or two ago.</p>

We have enough of a reminder of that from the US as it is (but the US doesn't attempt territorial expansion, for whatever that's worth).</p>

<p>"The U.S. doesn't attempt territorial expansion."</p><p>That's a lie. (Haven't you heard of how various parts of the southern United States were violently taken from Mexico? Or how about the Phillipines. I'd suggest you read a few history books about the horrendous, colonialist violence inflicted on the indigenous populations there, on the part of successive generations of American imperialist occupiers.)</p><p>The United States has a tragic and disgraceful history of imperialist cruelty all over the world, particularly in Latin America. No amount of revisionist lying on the part of America propagandists is going to erase that history.</p>

<blockquote>You realize that Mexico attacked US forces first, right?</blockquote><p></p><p>I'm assuming you're referring to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton_Affair" rel="nofollow">Thornton Affair</a>? That may have provided a sufficient casus belli for Polk (along with Mexico's rejection of John Slidell's offer to forgive $3 million in debt for damages incurred during their war of independence in addition to paying $25-$30 million for Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México), but it's virtually impossible to construe the Americans as anything other than the aggressors.</p><p>To do so would ignore America's repeated violations of Mexican sovereignty, such as John C. Frémont's military expedition into California in the winter of 1845-46, which culminated in him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Peak_%28California%29" rel="nofollow">building a fort</a> and raising the American flag at said fort. Afterwards, he went on to assist the Bear Flag Revolt. It also ignores American military intervention in the border dispute between Mexico and the Republic of Texas, as Polk sent 3,500 troops under Zachary Taylor in July 1845 to the Nueces River and authorized him to seize the disputed land by force if necessary.</p>

<blockquote>In those ' violations of Mexican sovereignty ' how many Mexican Soldiers were killed?</blockquote><p></p><p>It's irrelevant. America sent an armed expedition, built a fort and claimed it as their own on sovereign Mexican soil, then went on to provide direct military support to rebels. Taylor's expeditionary force on the Nueces Strip arrived months prior to Texas's annexation, while it was still being voted on in both Texas and the US. The US was intervening in what was a border dispute between two ostensibly sovereign nations.</p><p></p><blockquote>Mexico had a tradition of border violations, see the Dawson Massacre, since they never recognized Texas independence or them joining the USA.</blockquote><p></p><p>Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco without authorization from the Mexican government; he was also under coercion as he was imprisoned, thus the treaties had no legal standing. While Mexico was generally an unstable mess during this time, I don't believe any of the various governments ever ratified them or recognized them as legitimate. Perhaps most importantly, Santa Anna's treaties would not have been considered legitimate under the Mexican constitution, as he did not have the authority to sign such documents.</p>

<p>You are correct.  I am well aware of the US territorial conquests in the 19th and very early 20th centuries.  I've read a number of good books on the subjects.  Those events were also a long time ago when international norms were different.  Since that age of imperialism, the world catastrophe of the mid 20th century has reshaped the world order to a better place.  China is flouting this order now, not 100 years ago.  Why does that make it OK for China to behave like the US or Japan behaved 100 years ago, when the history is clear that acting in such a way only leads to destruction and chaos?   You cannot condemn the US for its history, and then turn around and use that history to excuse Chinese behavior in the present.  THAT is classic propaganda doublethink.</p>

<p>Of course, there's one crucial difference between the Soviet Union's millitary buildup and China's- Deng pegged the military buildup to GDP, insisting that the  military's share could never rise about 4% on his watch (unlike the Soviet Union, whose military took roughly 25-35% at it's peak).</p><p>It never has, but back when 4% meant 4% of squat, it wasn't much of a threat. Now that it's 4% of the world's second largest economy... that's a whole different ballgame.</p><p>Smart. Very, very smart.</p>

<p>This is highly inaccurate and biased. Unlike Russia, China has for a very long time claimed much of these areas. Russia voluntarily gave up Crimea in the 70s but has unilaterally reclaimed it. These areas that China and its neighbors claim are considered disputed territory within international law unlike Crimea which has been Ukrainian autonomous region for more than 40 years.</p><p>Second, some historical context. China has more land borders with other countries than any country in the world and because of that fact one of the most territorial disputes historically. It has resolved almost all of them (except with India) peacefully through negotiation. That is unprecedented as most territorial disputes are resolved militarily.</p><p>China's so called aggression in the S. China seas today is actually a tit for tat strategy when their negotiation offers have been rebuffed and they have come under aggressive behavior from its neighbors (such as when Japan allowed the government to buy a disputed island or Vietnam's aggressive naval actions). Remember, Japan didn't even consider the Islands China also claims to be disputed territory until last year. There was and probably still is no hope of negotiation.</p><p>Third, according to a study by the political scientist Joshua Goldstein, China is the most peaceful of all major military powers in the last 40 years.</p><p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/08/15/think_again_war" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/a...</a></p><p>So the odds of war, though bigger than most people imagine in these territorial disputes, may not necessarily be due to Chinese aggression as this and almost all other articles in the western press suggest.</p>

<p>You do realize that talking about negotiations to resolve a conflict and then describing the conflict as "peaceful" would mean that you are describing Vietnam and the Korean War as "peaceful resolved conflicts" right? Do you not understand how completely absurd that sounds?

<p>I never said the conflicts were peaceful. Do you need remedial reading lessons?  I said that they were resolved through peaceful negotiations (true). That doesn't mean nor imply that there weren't at some point some conflicts with some countries. BTW, the Korean war was not a territorial conflict between China and another country. </p>

<p>The majority of inter-state conflicts are resolved through negotiations and treaties. The statement is meaningless and misleading and mischaracterizes the substantive nature of the conflict itself by focusing on a pointless digression. How many negotiations *aren't* peaceful? I can't help but think that this is intentional obfuscation on your part.</p>

<p>Negotiation: <br>noun</p><p>1. mutual discussion and arrangement of the terms of a transaction or agreement: "the negotiation of a treaty."</p><p>You know, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Armistice_at_Compi%C3%A8gne#Negotiation_process" rel="nofollow">exactly what happened in the First Armistice at Compiègne</a>. If you would care to offer some wholly unique, not commonly accepted definition of negotiation that magically includes the resolution to the Korean War and not WW1, by all means offer it up. Until then, I'm afraid it appears you are the one that has no idea what they are talking about.</p>

<p>Dude, if there's a point to debating with strangers on the internet (a very big if) then it's the chance that you'll convince someone reading your comments that your position is the correct one.  Going on and on about how someone is paid by the PRC is doing nothing for your position.   Why don't you address his points instead of launching ad hominem attacks?  You've made your point that you think he's a paid shill, now engage intellectually or shut up.</p>

<p>Dismissing other people's opinion just because it does not gel with your preconceived notion is unproductive.  There is actually a peer-reviewed comprehensive study on China's border management done by a political scientist in MIT and it paints a very different picture than the popular belief of an expansionist China.</p><p><a href="http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/i8782.html" rel="nofollow">http://press.princeton.edu/cha...</a></p><p>The study is some what dated (published in 2008) but the main points in the study remain valid.</p>

<p>And thank you for voicing for all billion or so Chinese.  What you said is technically true.  China does not see any territorial dispute with Tibet.   According the PRC, Tibet is a wholly owned subsidiary.  60+ years of sometimes violent revolt against that ownership after a very violent invasion by the PRC does seem to indicate that the TIbetans do not consent to the arrangement.</p>

<p>Yes, your argument is in fact a red herring.  And a fat juicy one at that.  Even the southern states opted to fully rejoin the union (although I will concede it was a little like the situation in Tibet) after the civil war.  What you are implying is that what, every generation should have a vote on what country they want to be part of?  If that were to take place, the US would still very likely have 50 states.  China would be TIbetless.</p>

<p>I think that if every generation had a vote on what country they'd be part of, Hong Kong might leave China but I believe that in Tibet, it will be either a very close match or they will not leave.</p><p>Of course I could be wrong. Remember that migrants are not representative of whole populations. There are some Mandarin speaking Tibetans that I've met who are not pro independence. But from what I remember I think the Dalai Lama doesn't support complete independence either. </p>

<p>You are absolutely incorrect; unlike Xinjiang or Inner Mongolia, which have been flooded with Han colonists over the last two centuries until they are, respectively, 45% and 85% Han, Tibet remains well over 80% ethnically Tibetan. Even leaving aside religious issues, those Tibetans constitute an abused majority with little more political and economic power than Africans had under Apartheid. Direct racism isn't as prevalent, but the sheer prevalence of the security state and the automatic suspicion it exercises towards non-Han people in Tibet put the worst excesses of Stop-and-Frisk to shame.</p><p>Put it to a vote and I guarantee they'd leave in a heartbeat, but Beijing understandably cannot consider the possibility as the Tibetan Plateau contains the headwaters for the river systems which supply three-quarters of a billion people with water and food. What it would do, if it was even vaguely reasonable on the issue, is try to treat the locals well enough that they wouldn't feel the need to leave, just as it should be doing in Xinjiang, which it similarly *must* control in order to secure overland access to energy resources from Central Asia and Russia.</p>

<p>Should South Central LA or Harlem secede from the United States because of racism? Is the US holding on to Puerto Rico because it has the valuable Arecibo observatory?</p><p>Come on of course any minority faces bigotry, which is part of the reason China's affirmative action program reaches further than that of the US. Of course the struggle against racism isn't over but it's a continual process. BTW. Tibetan people live all over China not just in Tibet or historic areas where they used to live.</p><p>Many people of Tibetan race, for example, migrate to Shanghai and other major cities without an issue. They join the Communist party and have regular jobs, live in suburbs like everyone else. </p>

All the significant logstical links and markets are there, and the Han control all the businesses. They might have a freer government, like Mongolia, but that's about it- Mongolia is also pretty much a wholly-owned subsidiary of China, Inc. (or at least a three-quarters owned subsidiary).</p>

<p>There are already independent countries with a similar cultural background to Tibet and Xin Jiang such as Bhutan and Uzbekistan.</p><p>Look I don't give a damn if they become independent but I just think a lot of pro-West commentators use 'free Tibet' as an excuse to screw with countries that aren't soft colonies of the US.</p><p>The vast majority of people in China, regardless of area, honestly don't give a damn. But from what I know about these areas like Tibet, that are economically depressed and net tax recipients, is that many residents have good reason to want to remain as part of China economically.</p><p>BTW. Only Inner Mongolia is politically part of China, the other parts are more influenced by Russia.</p>

<p>Outer Mongolia is culturally and politically influenced by their ties to the old USSR, but today is basically an economic satrap of the PRC. Russia doesn't need their resources- China does. Tibet, similarly, has all it's logistical and business ties to the Chinese metropolitan core, and would still be under their economic domination were it "independent".</p>

<p>First of all Tibet was part of the former Mongolian and Manchurian empires, which also colonized central China. The issue is that I think they consented to be part of Mongolia and Manchuria, and those cultures were historically very different from mainstream Chinese culture, but more similar to Tibet.</p><p>When the socialist revolution happened it spread to many Asian countries. If Tibet had become independent, it may have become Soviet like Mongolia. Actually, one issue with Tibet was that the US's CIA went there in the 1950s to get them to break from socialism.</p><p>A lot of the public opinion you hear about free Tibet etc. comes from people living in Nepal and India. I don't know if they're representative of Tibetans in general. </p>

<p>"The issue is that I think they consented to be part of Mongolia and Manchuria, and those cultures were historically very different from mainstream Chinese culture, but more similar to Tibet."</p><p>They did not have a vote so you don't know if they consented. I think the population and the leaders were completely against being subjugated by the Mongols. But in the case of China, at least the Dalai Lama consented during the 18th century that China had suzerainty over Tibet. See Melvyn Goldstein's book, The Snow Lion and the Dragon for example.</p>

<p>In my experience in traveling through Tibetan areas, they do want the same things Han Chinese want, adequate wages, housing, environment, and education for their children. That's top concern. Some very religious people such as monks are concerned about establishing an independent religious state or for the return of the Dalai Lama but most are far more concerned with the everyday issues.</p>

<p>Yeah unfortunately the struggle against racism isn't over, but there's definitely an effort toward affirmative action and helping Tibetan kids go to college and more. For example racial quotas in college and high school admissions. </p>

You see, there is a thing called international law. There is no country that has denied that Tibet is a part of China. Even the Dalai Lama claims that it is a part of China. But white people like you love to speak on behalf of others.</p><p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Tibet-part-of-China-Dalai-Lama-agrees/2005/03/14/1110649129309.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/news/Wor...</a></p><p>"Tibet is a part of the People's Republic of China.

<p>I'm much less interested in the substance of your talking points than observing that you are quite clearly a paid spokesperson for the People's Republic of China.  If I wanted to debate the official Chinese talking points, I could just call the embassy and talk with someone who is at least upfront about who is paying them to say what they're saying.</p><p>I mean, c'mon...there's no conflict between Tibet and China?  That's just a bridge too far, my Sino friend.</p>

<p>Great, I'm not a paid agent of the PRC so I have nothing to worry about. You can't win an argument so you have to rely on threats to report someone for expressing a different opinion from you. Even the US courts require some form of evidence which you don't have and will never get. So go ahead, sock puppet.</p>

<p>There isn't a dispute, because there's no such thing as Tibet, at least as far as the nation-state system is concerned. It would be like saying "the dispute between the US and the Lakota Nation"; the Lakota may argue that they're a conquered people whose land was taken from them, but there was never a Lakota nation-state as such that was recognized by the world. Tibet? Same.</p>

<p>There was a Tibetan state before they joined the Mongolian and later Manchurian metastates. It was recognized by many countries in Asia. There are also people of Tibetan heritage living in various parts of China.</p><p>But a lot of areas that have a problem with the Chinese government have problems with what they perceive as big-government policies, such as traditional Chinese laicization vs. their attitude regarding church and state.</p><p>BTW. Check out this series on the history of socialism in Tibet. Actually many people supported the revolution originally. <br><a href="http://kasamaproject.org/history/1290-22the-true-story-of-maoist-revolution-in-tibet-part-1" rel="nofollow">http://kasamaproject.org/histo...</a></p>

<p>It was a kingdom; not a state in the modern, westphalian-system sense. Their lack of a sense of statehood went to the point that when offered recognition by the United Nations in the late 1940s, they rejected it, insisting that they were part of China. This was the way the situation stood until it became clear to the Dalai Lama's clique in the late 50s that they wouldn't have the autonomy that they expected and had enjoyed under previous regimes and dynasties... at which point they began to retroactively claim statehood. A decade and a half too late. (Note that the ROC government on Taiwan has never rescinded their claim to Tibet or Xinjiang either- or Outer Mongolia for that matter, which is a recognized, independent state.)</p><p>It becomes increasingly evident when you look at what the Tibetan Government in Exile claims as Tibet, which includes a lot more than the Xizang rump-province; it includes all of Qinghai, which is less than a third Tibetan to begin with, and has historically had large populations of Hui, Han, and other minorities. The Dalai Lama himself was born in Gansu province, which has been recognized as part of the Chinese core going back for centuries, but contains many Tibetan villages.</p><p>The whole idea of a Tibetan "state" simply doesn't make sense when superimposed on the ethnic complexities of central Asia. Same as the various manufactured "states" of the Middle East.</p>

<p>Honestly according to the Westphalian nation-state concept, many non-Western societies were not 'states' until quite recently.

<p>Agreed. There's just so much misinformation that makes it sound like there was this "happy Shangri-la kingdom of Tibet" that was peacefully minding it's own business in Buddhist harmony when the big, bad Chinese communists invaded. Um, no. There was a patchwork of ethnic Tibetan kingdoms and communities that had been part of the Qing empire along with many other central and Southeast Asian tribes. After the fall of the Qing, they meandered their own way, sometimes under various foreign (Indian, Soviet, Chinese) influences, but remained part of the new Chinese Republic for all nominal purposes, and never really rejected it's position as Chinese territory- until it became clear that China wanted to run it as a Chinese territory, and not as a Tibetan-administered tributary sending tax revenues to Beijing in exchange for military protection. Which reminds me of another territory that's in the news a lot right now, but that's another story...</p>

<p>Much of the blood you are talking was spilled by native Crimean Tartars... Countless thousands were murdered by the Red Terror in 1920. Countless thousands more died of starvation in the famine of 1921/22, when the Soviets confiscated all their grain.  Tens of thousands more were murdered in the terror of 1929 in the Crimea.   Then even more during the purges of 1937/38. Then the entire population of Tartars was deported to Siberia in 1944 for collaborating with the Germans (yes..the Tartars found them easier to get along with than the Soviets), killing countless thousands more.   They eventually returned to the Crimea but in numbers far less than a few generations earlier.</p><p>You are wrong about Khrushchev being a Ukrainian.  Most school children know he was born in Kalinovka, Russia, which is near Kursk.  He was 100% Russian. He was the Soviet Commissar to the Ukraine however.  Stalin wanted another Russian keeping them under his heal.  I am assuming you are just making up facts to support him making the Crimea part of the Ukraine.  He did so primarily because all land links to the peninsula from the mainland went through the Ukraine.</p><p>Besides that, you are right.  After Russia defeated the Turks, and started eliminating the native tartars, they did achieve a majority of Russians there.</p><p>Nobody except you and other Russians feel that justifies them to invade and confiscate part of a sovereign nation however.</p>

<p>Look at the map of claim by the Chinese and see how it extends south through international waters and into the internationally ratified (200km) zones of the affected countries. <br>And in the case of one of the disputed island chains, it was owned by a Japanese national who sold to the Japanese government. <br>Here in Australia we are considering buying cutting edge submarines off the shelf from the Japanese, and the howls of protest from the Chinese have been long and loud. <br>Meanwhile they are setting up bases in Australias' designated zone within Antartica...and they've cruised their warships off the Australian coast in the Indian Ocean to intimidate our government when we approved a US Marine training base in the tropical north of our country..they really do have a very unsophisticated bully streak in their behaviour..</p>

<p>Internationally ratified zones? Are you sure you know what you are talking about? Are you thinking about International waters which sometimes stretches beyond 200 nautical miles beyond the shore line (not 200 km as you claimed)?</p><p>Anyway, as for the Sino-Japanese island, it is not beyond 200 nautical miles of Chinese shores. It less than 200 nautical miles from from mainland Chinese shores and about 140 km from Taiwan and also 140 km from Ishigaki Islands and 410 km from a main Japanese island (Naha)</p>

<p>I like the subtle shift in your own statement from nautical miles when referencing *Chinese* territorial claims to kilometers when referencing other territorial claims.</p><p>I also wonder how you reconcile this argument about "main Japanese island" of Naha (thus conveniently excluding Sakishima-Sohto, despite there being towns and cities with continual populations) with the construction of Islands being used to expand territorial claims far south of Mainland China which are clearly within 200 nautical miles of the coasts of Vietnam and the Philippines. For those wondering, the closest island of the Sakishima-Soto group is 200 kilometers from the Senkaku islands, or 108 nautical miles.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? You confused km with nautical miles. I pointed that out. The Island is actually closest to Taiwan (140 km which is less than 108 nautical miles). BTW, both the Taiwanese government and the PRC claim that Taiwan is part of China.</p>

<p>Again, you're deeply confused. Anyone with a three digit IQ  can convert nautical miles to km and see that what I said is perfectly consistent. BTW, I referenced all three Japanese AND Chinese and Taiwanese claims in km. I only talked about nautical miles when I was talking about the standard LOS definition which uses nautical miles (which is there usage for general claims). You're confused because you have a double digit IQ. </p>

<p>What a bunch of rubbish.  Long claimed ?   The Philippines has given dozens of examples of those islands never being claimed.  The only major survey done of them by a chinese dynasty was done by Kublai Khan, a mongol who at the time had had conquered Korea, was invading Vietnam, was getting ready to invade Japan (stopped by the Kamakazi..divine wind), and wanted to see what else was out there to lay his hands on.</p><p>Besides that, it was a Nationalist Chinese Cartographer who whimsically put the 9-dash line on a 1946 map he was drawing.  That is the strength of the Chinese claim.   They had no settlements on the island, and it was Vietnamese, Malay, and Filipino fisherman and traders more than Chinese who plied these waters over the last 3000 years.</p><p>As far as the last 40 years... that number was put in place since it allows for the following not to be mentioned...</p><p>The Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949<br>The Chinese invasion of South Korea in 1950<br>Armed conflict with Taiwan over Matsu and Quemoy in 1958/59<br>The Chinese invasion of India in 1962<br>The Amur River conflict in 1969<br>The disastrous 1979 invasion of South Vietnam<br>Now..they are close to conflict with Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan.</p><p>Yes... throughout their 65 year history, the Chinese have been a beacon of peace.</p>

<p>This list is absurd if anybody knows anything.  But just one example, China invaded India in 1962?</p><p>Sure the Indian has been saying this for a long time, and they still insist that they are just hapless innocent victim against big bad China.  In fact at the time of the incident, the West overwhelmingly take the Indian line.  After all isn't India a democracy and China a Communist nation and that's the end of the story?</p><p>Nowadays a body of works has emerged and challenge this narrative and they give a quite convincing evidence that it is India who is the belligerent.  Here are two links for anyone who is interested.</p><p><a href="http://gregoryclark.net/redif.html" rel="nofollow">http://gregoryclark.net/redif....</a></p><p><a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/news-events/podcasts/renewed-tension-indiachina-border-whos-blame" rel="nofollow">http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/...</a></p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't say that China has "no soft power."  Actually, I did write that at first but edited it almost immediately.  Much has been written about China's attempts to cultivate soft power.  At the risk of posting a TLDR reply, I'm going to quote below some excerpts from an article in Foreign Policy that I think elucidates what I mean when I say China suffers from a "lack of diplomacy and soft power".</p><p>Before I do, I just want to remark that it seems to me that much of the cheering for China around the world has not at its core an enthusiasm for Chinese culture or policy, but a desire to see an abatement of the power of the United States.  This is in marked contrast to American soft power.  I've lived in Turkey, a country with some of the highest disapproval rates of US foreign policy in the world.  Yet everywhere I went, people were genuinely delighted to meet an American (even in Istanbul where drunkenly partying Westerners are a common annoyance).  During every conversation I had about world events, I was emphatically informed that Turkish people liked Americans, even though they disliked the actions of our government.</p><p>That's soft power.</p><p>When I met my wife's cousin, a senior engineer tasked with retrofitting Istanbul's buildings for earthquake preparedness, an Herculean effort that should give some clue to his level of intelligence, he was beside himself with glee to sit down and chat with an American.  My poor wife could hardly keep up the translation with all the things he wanted to say.  One thing in particular stuck with me.  He said that a Turk like my wife could go to America and become an American.  But the Turks whose great grandparents went to Germany still aren't Germans.</p><p>That's also soft power.</p><p>People around the world watch Hollywood movies (and complain about them as much as we do, but still watch them--like we do), listen to our pop music, watch our tv shows, and read gossip about our celebrities.  There's a disconcertingly huge gap in their understanding of how our society works, but nevertheless they have a direct connection with us through our culture.</p><p>Again, soft power.</p><p>Despite China's efforts to fund projects in third world countries, there's just no parallel between global attitudes toward China and the examples I cited above.</p><p>Ok, here's some more thoughts on soft power from Harvard professor Joseph S. Nye from that FP article:</p><p></p><blockquote>The soft power of a country rests primarily on three resources: its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority).<br><br>Much of America's soft power is produced by civil society -- everything from universities and foundations to Hollywood and pop culture -- not from the government. Sometimes the United States is able to preserve a degree of soft power because of its critical and uncensored civil society even when government actions -- like the invasion of Iraq -- are otherwise undermining it. <br><br>Even China's soft-power triumphs, such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics, have quickly turned stale. Not long after the last international athletes had departed, China's domestic crackdown on human rights activists undercut its soft power gains. Again in 2009, the Shanghai Expo was a great success, but it was followed by the jailing of Nobel Peace Laureate Liu Xiaobo and screens were dominated by scenes of an empty chair at the Oslo ceremonies.<br><br>China and Russia make the mistake of thinking that government is the main instrument of soft power. In today's world, information is not scarce but attention is, and attention depends on credibility. Government propaganda is rarely credible. The best propaganda is not propaganda. For all the efforts to turn Xinhua and China Central Television into competitors to CNN and the BBC, there is little international audience for brittle propaganda. As the Economist noted about China, "the party has not bought into Mr. Nye's view that soft power springs largely from individuals, the private sector, and civil society. So the government has taken to promoting ancient cultural icons whom it thinks might have global appeal." But soft power doesn't work that way. As Pang Zhongying of Renmin University put it, it highlights "a poverty of thought" among Chinese leaders. </blockquote><p></p><p><a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/what_china_and_russia_don_t_get_about_soft_power" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/a...</a></p>

<p>I don't know about reading, writing, and speaking, but I'd certainly rather type in English.  We don't even have to worry about diacriticals, let alone logosyllabic scripts.</p><p>But you raise an excellent point that relates to soft power.  English is the global lingua franca of business and science and technology.  The historical reasons why this is so are obvious.  But having taught English abroad, I also think there are some intrinsic reasons why English accounts for 60% of all foreign language learning in the world.</p><p>English has a reputation as one of the more difficult languages in the world to master because of non-phonetic spellings, idioms, homonyms, homophones, homographs, lack of any central authority over usages, and the sheer number of words, including archaic, technical, and scientific terminology, among other reasons.</p><p>This depth of vocabulary is not a weakness, it's a strength.  It makes English more efficient.  When the same block of text is issued in multiple languages, the English version is nearly always the shortest one since there's usually a word that perfectly conveys the meaning, rather than the wordy work-arounds other languages often have to employ.</p><p>Despite English's reputation for being tough to master, it's also considered one of the easiest languages to start learning and using at a beginner/intermediate level.  Here are some reasons why English is considered one of the easiest languages to learn (but not master):</p><p>Verb conjugation: A typical French verb has more than fifty endings that must be learned. A regular English verb has four.</p><p>Irregular verbs: It would take less than a page to list all irregular forms of all irregular verbs in English, as compared with sixteen pages for Spanish. All English irregular verbs except “to be” and “to have” are irregular in the same way.</p><p>English noun and adjectival forms:  Unlike most other European languages, nouns are not more or less arbitrarily divided as being “masculine,” “feminine,” or “neuter.” Adjectives need not change to match noun gender form, nor do they change if a noun is plural.</p><p>Written versus spoken forms: Some languages, including French, German, and Greek, among others are very different in their formal written and casual spoken forms. English is not one of these.</p><p></p>

<p>Not all Guest posts are mine.  I made the smart a$$ reply, "Thank you, um...honored guest." but I didn't type "Well stated Duncan..." Geez, how egomaniacal do you think I am?</p><p>Don't answer that please.</p><p>[edit, wait a minute, are you seeing both PW and my reply to him as Guest also?  I'm just curious if Disqus is so buggy it's showing Guest to one user and not another.  For reference, PW starts:  "I'm not so sure. Tell all the Africans..." and my reply "I certainly wouldn't say that China has.."  Those are the two posts above Manny Chen's.  If you're seeing those as "done by a poster named 'Guest', too."  then Disqus is even more messed up than I thought.</p><p></p>

<p>I see them as posted by "Guest"; both of them.<br>Till you mentioned that one of the "Guest" posts was yours, I would not have thought it was you. No, I did not think you were applauding yourself - but just wanted to be sure. Yes, Disqus seems to have been "infiltrated" by the 50 cents army, as well as the 30 rubles army on other blogs, just to mess with our liberal, democratic, capitalist, American minds (or what passes for that)...</p>

<p>Gaah!  I replied to you and then I thought I should add a "who are", which I contracted to oops can't type it because Disqus thought I was using a bad word and now my comment is waiting to be approved and we all know that means it's gone forever.</p><p>Copy/paste from that post:</p><p>The fact that we're seeing different users as Guest makes this a much stranger and more troubling problem.  If you're correct that it's the troll armies <i><b>WHO ARE</b></i> behind this, and not the Thetans that were my first guess, then that would really suck.  As bad as The Atlantic comments can be, this site is miles above most of the other news and commentary sites on the interweb.</p>

<p>If those little trolls can get into well-protected bank networks, as they have repeatedly done so recently, I fail to see how Disqus could even present a mediocre challenge to them.<br>But yes, other forums being what they are, the Atlantic's forum is actually not that bad, at all. Even previously decent ones have degenerated into smoke filled biker (leftist and/or rightist) bars where its not worth one's time and effort to enter, unless one has an inordinate fondness for senseless howling and baying coupled with vicious brawls, without any hope of a reasonable outcome for anyone...</p>

<p>Chinese infrastructure in Africa is great if you need to drive from an oilfield to an oil refinery to an oil port while avoiding any major cities or trade routes. The locals are good enough to dig ditches but the Chinese require imported labor for precise, delicate work like basic construction. They do send a lot of money for housing development and you can see that it's working - the officials who collect it develop much larger houses.</p><p>China is about as popular in Africa as the United Fruit Company was in Central America.</p>

<p>"he locals are good enough to dig ditches but the Chinese require imported labor for precise, delicate work like basic construction."</p><p>Depends. Dambisa Moyo found out otherwise- in countries with underdeveloped labor forces, like Angola or Mozambique, this was generally true- Chinese employees either equalled or outnumbered African employees on projects. OTOH, in countries with more developed labor forces, like Senegal, Ghana or Botswana, Chinese were generally outnumbered by Africans 20:1 or 30:1. If the locals have the talents they need, which in the more educated nations they do, they hire them. If they don't, they import them.</p><p>"They do send a lot of money for housing development and you can see that it's working - the officials who collect it develop much larger houses."</p><p>Sub-Saharan African nations with a lot of Chinese investment are suddenly posting GDP growth rates in the 8-10% range. Why is that?</p><p>Chinese projects are denominated in RMB. You know what the great thing about RMB is? It's non-transferrable, and only useful for importing goods from China or construction contracts. Unlike Euros or Dollars, which can be smuggled offshore by elites, used to buy expensive luxury products or offshore real estate. So suddenly the influx of RMB is plugging the leaky sieve of "free trade", and igniting the local economies.</p><p>Check out Dambisa Moyo or Deborah Brautigam's works for the full story of why China's popularity has risen in Africa.</p>

<p>I am not sure what you mean, but my point was simple: the will to confront an aggressor is more important than anything else. I am much more concerned about that, than any new spending on weapons. We can spend all we have if we do not have the will to use those brand new very expensive and oh-so-impressive weapons. Confronting a bully has nothing to do with toys, but everything to do with the will to do it.</p>

<p>Weapons and their quality and quantity are not toys. They are what determines the outcome. The outcome means, who wins and who loses. The losing side is often gone altogether. Where is the Axis now? Where is Biafra? Where is the last year's snow? <br>When facing very large potential enemies, one needs to think about survival too, among other things.</p>

<p>You might have missed the two last military engagements we had been involved in, Iraq and Afghanistan, but I seriously doubt that there is anyone, including the Iraqis and the Afghans, who would doubt that we, the US, had by far the best and most weapons in either military theater, and I don't really think it is in doubt that, we did not accomplish the military aims we had when we got involved in either country. We were not willing to do what was needed to accomplish our missions we set out to accomplish at the beginning of the hostilities. I really don't think that the point I made has not been sufficiently demonstrated by the adduced examples. So, again, it is not the weapons at all, but the will to fight is what matters. We, the US, have both the qualitative and the quantitative edge over the Chinese when it comes to any military metric, save the number of troops, but that is immaterial in the naval theater we are discussing here; and we will maintain that qualitative and quantitative edge for many years to come - the will to fight I am not sure about at all...</p>

<p>The American and Japanese forces used to be large in West Pacific, but now they are small. It is not that the US and Japan got shrunk, it  is the other side that grew bigger.<br>The only way to have peace is to have Western forces large enough to reliably deter aggression. This is not easy considering that China is much larger than the US in human resources and roughly the same size economically. Small countries when threatened rely on universal draft, which gives them large reserves in case of need.<br>Asia would be much more peaceful if American reservists were coming there once a year with reserve ships and aircraft to train and check what is going on there.</p>

<p>Yes, but close to China there are also the land-based missiles, including ballistic anti-ship, and land--based aircraft. The space between China and Taiwan is not exactly open ocean.</p>

<p>Oh for God's sake. Here (sigh) yet again, we have another jingoistic article by America's chicken-hawk armchair warriors, whining about "how awful it is that China, might want to dominate the South CHINA Sea".</p><p>Stop to think about that one, for a second or two. The CHINESE want to "dominate" the CHINA Sea... and America, a country located thousands of miles to the east, literally on the other side of the world, is fulminating with indignation at this "affront".</p><p>America -- the country that has, for over 200 years, famously (via the Monroe Doctrine) violently resisted the establishment of ANY non-American great power military relationship in the Western Hemisphere -- is now shrieking outrage at the idea that the Chinese, might actually want to "dominate" a body of water that is right off the coasts of Shanghai... while American nuclear-armed battle fleets cruise up and down that sea, just spoilin' for a fight.</p><p>What, pray tell, do you think the American reaction would be, if the Chinese were, for example, sailing ships and submarines, all armed to the teeth with deliverable thermonuclear weapons, up and down the Sea of Cortes, or maybe off the coasts of Big Sur and Long Island?</p><p>Tell you what, America -- how about you withdraw your battle fleets from the South CHINA Sea, and the Chinese will promise not to start sailing the same, within spittin' distance of Malibu or Martha's Vineyard.</p><p>How about that? Sound like a deal?</p>

<p>Let's actually come up with a useful analogy here, if we're going to use analogies.</p><p>Let us say that the United States is a rising power, expanding economically for the first time in about two centuries after being kicked around as a colonial battlefield by everyone with a navy for a long period of time. We HATE... let's say Colombia... because they invaded us a 70 years ago and we're good at holding a grudge. Futhermore, we regard Mexico, Canada, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and EVERYTHING ELSE around us as little more than wayward vassal states who'd best get the h*ll back in line, or else. We have irredentist claims on territory with almost every nation we border, and we throw our weight around, frankly bullying the hell out of anyone we think can't stand up to us. Furthermore, we have a domestic historical and media narrative that reads like a German propaganda piece in 1935, and an utterly opaque and somewhat unstable government that views foreign policy as a tool in maintaining domestic power. Do you think the global powers that be in this situation wouldn't regard us as a legitimate threat to peace in our corner of the world?</p>

<p>don't know why Indonesia is not discussed more in these conversations about east Asian geopolitics.  they have a huge population, a large land mass, and they control a lot of the navigable waterways from the Indian Ocean into these disputed areas.  also happens to be a Muslim country.</p><p>China has a lot to deal with.  the environment could collapse before any of this territorial stuff matters.</p>

<p>I was on Palawan in May.  I spent a lot of time there as a matter of fact.  I did not see any Korean, Vietnamese or Chinese signs anywhere. I'm sure there must have been a few I did not notice, but nothing like the author claims.  The "rickshaws" he is talking about are called trikes, and they are ubiquitous in the Philippines.</p><p>I'm assuming the author is simply making this up to add to spice to his story.</p>

<div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto">

<p>I find it depressing that this article only provides two or three paragraphs focused on the actual driver of Chinese foreign policy, that is, Chinese domestic politics.</p><p>There are two core issues which drive foreign provocations under Xi's government. First, looking at his policies from the standpoint of intraparty factionalism: Quite frankly, Xi himself is NOT popular with the PLA. He's the leading figure in a faction of the CCP which seeks to curb (to some extent, anyway) the corruption and ridiculous abuse of authority. His initiatives and campaigns span the whole party, but the PLA's leadership represents a concentration of the sort of behavior he is attempting to reign in and they therefore intensely dislike him. This is compounded by the fact that his faction has its roots in the relatively prosperous and well-educated urban classes and its leaders are mostly descendants of former Party high-ups (hence the name "Princelings"), which means that the mostly dirt-poor, rural enlisted personnel and NCO's of the PLA also dislike (perhaps "hate" is a better word) him and his faction.</p><p>Thus, the PLA represents the only center of power in the Party with the strength and cohesiveness to upend his reform agenda, or, if the generals sense that he poses an existential threat to them and their privilege, to go beyond channels and remove or sideline him entirely. His pandering to nationalist sentiments in his foreign policy is at least in part driven by his need to keep the allegiance of the army's low- and mid-ranking personnel, who are generally poorly or moderately educated and thus rabidly nationalist. If he can keep them onboard, he can thwart any attempts by the PLA leadership to scuttle his anti-corruption drives or threaten his own person and leadership, making them fear that their sword will turn in their hand if they strike a blow with it.</p><p>Secondly, from a broader societal standpoint: Chinese economic growth over the last 30 years has provided sufficient "bread and circuses" to most of the urban population to keep them onboard with the program. In short, the current Chinese social contract with the urban populace reads: "you get a continually higher standard of living, and we keep political control." This is no longer sustainable in the cities as economic growth starts to slow and the massive inequalities and structural flaws which arose in those 30 years become apparent.</p><p>Yet, even most of the urban population is still not educated particularly well, and very few are cosmopolitan or open in the sense that many Americans and most Europeans are. Pandering to their nationalist sensibilities still *works*, and in the absence of continued double-digit economic growth, it can ensure urban support for continued Party rule despite them having shuffled political liberalization to the back burner and then turning off the stove. With the Party not only being assertive abroad but also prosecuting a moderately effective (if slow) crackdown on corruption at home, it can probably ensure relative urban stability and support for or acquiescence to continued Party rule.</p><p>The rural picture is even more complicated; rural areas have seen only a fraction of the economic growth and development of urban ones, but because of that their educational systems lag severely and are much more propagandized. This means that the best ways to keep them in line are to play to their nationalist and xenophobic instincts and promote the image of the Party as a caring and kind uncle to the masses; the former is covered by Chinese belligerence abroad, especially towards traditional enemies that rural residents have been encouraged to hate by their own elders and a heavily propagandized reading of history, while the latter is fulfilled through the current anti-corruption campaigns.</p><p>In short, Chinese belligerence abroad and the resulting poor relations with the neighbors is the price that Xi has to pay to find a way of replacing rapid economic growth as the primary support for Party legitimacy. Party rule will stand or fall on its ability to control its own corruption (for which Xi needs the support of the PLA's rank and file) and keep Chinese ultranationalists contented without actually provoking a war. Thus, we have saber rattling all over the Chinese periphery, because the leadership of the Party simply do not care about foreign opinion or goodwill at present. It is a luxury they cannot afford: their entire system is balanced on a knife's edge, and with it their power, and the only people with the power to affect it live within China's borders.</p>

<p>I agree with your post and appreciate your insight.  however, i tend to view the environment as China's major problem.  obviously this is connected with the economy of China, but I can't see how the degradation can continue into the future, even if the growth rate slows dramatically.  so much damage has already been done.</p><p>people will have to deal with the pollution long after the Party is booted out for a sluggish and corrupt economy...</p>

<p>1) This was a by the numbers recitation of the conventional wisdom.  This article includes exactly one fact I -- a moderately interested layman -- didn't already know.  Well, maybe two: I had no idea Vietnamese diplomats could be so droll.</p><p>2) If the U.S. is going to have alliances in the region, we best be ready to throw down for them.  Strategic ambiguity won't work wrt China.</p><p>If we're willing to go to war to protect the Philippines, or Taiwan, or Japan then we need to be loud and clear about it; if we're not, then we shouldn't leave anyone with that impression.</p><p>Being seen as guaranteeing another nation's security when we're not willing to actually do it is a lose/lose position.</p><p>3) This is reason 663 to not treat China like a regular country.  This is a country that executes political prisoners to harvest their organs.  China should be facing the sort of sanctions usually associated with Iran, North Korea, and Saddam's Iraq.</p><p>That whole 'constructive engagement' approach is a huge failure (unless of course one supposes it's real purpose was to provide cover for companies seeking to make money by trading with China.  And by trading with I mean exploiting the cheap labor supply.  In that case it was a total success).</p>

<p>Just bomb China!  The arrogant Chinese idiots are the bane of the civilized world.  Just travel in China and you will see how the people live.  They may have the money but they are still uncivilized.  You can see in their parks how the Chinese make the green lawns their toilet, dropping their feces for everyone to see!</p>

<p>China's position is no different from US position in early 20 century when Great Brittan was sizing the US up for a war. It was avoided when US, Japan, and Great Britain signed naval treaty. Democracy was not a factor. History never repeats itself but rhyme.</p>

<p>Both Southeastern Asian claimants and the US are using each other for their perspective gains; for the U.S. geopolitical leverage against China and for the smaller flies in the southeast Asian claimants and Japan (in East China Sea dispute with China) a perceived deterrent or protection in the case of Japan and the Philippines. The danger is that some small flies (like the Serb guy in Sarajevo) could cause mighty nations to go to self-destructive war like that in Europe in 1914 (which cost Britain superpower status and losing its grip on its colonies worldwide); that same thing could happen to the US as well albeit "exceptional" or "near chosen," if the US is not careful.</p>

<p>Great Article however, the author never discussed "soft power" and the cultural relationship that Japan and the United States share with each<br>other. Americans (those who know the difference between China and Japan)<br>overwhelmingly despise China and have multiple cultural ties to Japanese<br>culture. The true and final question is: Are Americans willing to die for<br>Tokyo? Beijing thinks not but, I’m willing to wager that Beijing is wrong. The<br>next few Aircraft carriers we decommission should be gifted to Japan. The President<br>should visit the Yaukuni Shrine along with the UK and Australian Prime Ministers.<br>There is no reason why China, a morally bankrupt oppressive dictatorship should<br>be anything besides a pariah in the eyes of the international community. The<br>Dalai Lama still cannot return home, Tibet is not free, Hong Kong is oppressed,<br>and the South China sea is not for sale.</p>

<p>It is a cliche that autocrats seek (or create) an external enemy when feeling threatened.  Jst now Xi Jiping is confronting democracy-minded students in Hong Kong and an economy that may be in impending meltdown.  So go to the playbook and do what works.</p>
